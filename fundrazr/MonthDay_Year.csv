"3,840",Eli Howey's top surgery/studio clear-out fundraise,Canadian Dollar,"Nov 27, 2017",of $3.5k goal,72,"I got my date for top surgery a few days ago, thankfully its a lot
  sooner than it was initially planned. I'm very excited to get this
  done before next summer, I've been binding for 5 plus years and other
  than being a physical discomfort while biking, swimming, exercising,
  in change rooms, singing, during hot weather giving skin irritations
  etc...psychologically it is something I want to move on from as a part
  of my gender transition. After I'm healed i will be able to move
  around more easily and exist a lot more safely in public like at the
  gym, in locker rooms, while traveling, swimming and other normal stuff
  that are currently very stressful and not really avoidable. I don't feel comfortable just asking for help without providing
  something in return so I've added lots of 'perks' as this website
  calls them. I am an artist and printmaker so please take this
  opportunity to get some art, clothing or comics from me. This will
  also help clear out my studio and get me pumped to make some new work
  after my recovery. So I'm getting Periareolar (Keyhole mastectomy) and chest conturing
  which will cost $2260.00, the rest of the money is for medication,
  recovery time and shipping costs for clothes and posters. EDIT: i raised the goal because the paypal/fundrazr charges are
  actually a lot and i wont be able to afford shipping otherwise! sorry

435,Getting Don colorblind glasses!,U.S. Dollar,"Nov 1, 2017",of $429 goal,8,"DID YOU KNOW? Donny has red/green color deficiency o r
          ""colorblindness"" So while he can see most color he
          struggles to see certain colors or certain colors look
          different to him than to you and I. It's difficult to say if
          he even sees ""real"" colors the way we do. We play
          the ""what color is this?"" game a lot. -Sometimes Don can't
          differentiate between Guacamole and Bean dip without having to
          taste it since sometimes they are the same color to him. -He gave his sister food
          poisoning once because he couldn't tell that the chicken he
          cooked was still pink. (pink tends to look grey to him) -Speaking of which, this one
          time we were playing the Slug Bug game and this light blue beetle was driving by and he
          yelled ""PINK SLUG BUG"" before punching me- he
          cheated and we haven't played that game since. -He has to change the color
          options in his video games. Bad guys = red, team
          members=green, yeah... he can't tell most of the time so he
          ends up losing a lot because he doesn't shoot the bad guy or

          Blue or vice versa in his world. I don't think he could see
          our wedding colors properly. I'm pretty sure he agreed to the
          color because I liked it and didn't want to disappoint me. -I've caught him asking little
          kids what colors were. Not because that's an adult thing to do

          me ""what color are these?"" I've rescued him many
          times from buying the worst poop-colored pants. So. Many. Times. There's a ton more stories
          about Don and his color deficiency but it's part of our daily
          life we don't realize how lacking it
          truly is until its put in perspective, which makes for some
          funny stories. He's wanted to get these

          splurge on getting them. With your support we'd love for him
          to finally get them! Our goal is to get him two pairs, both
          the indoor and outdoor pair. Of course if we can get one of

"13,715",Drew’s leukemia fight,U.S. Dollar,,of $20k goal,134,"Drew Aufderheide was diagnosed 2 1/2 years ago with a rare and
  incurable form of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) .  Only 5,000 per
  year in the United States are diagnosed with this disease and because
  the cancer is caused by a chromosomal change, there is no way to cure
  it - only medication to keep it at bay.  At the age of 33, it is
  extremely rare for someone like Drew to have this form of leukemia. 
  It is normally diagnosed in people with an average age of 67, and the
  life expectancy is approximately 15 years. There are currently a lot
  of unknown facts surrounding Drew's case because physicians and
  oncologists do not often see CML in someone so young and because of
  Drew's young age, his life expectancy is unknown. What is known, is that Drew needs to take a maintenance chemo
  drug/pill each day to manage the CML for the rest of his life, or
  until a cure is discovered.  There are only a few drugs available at
  this time to treat this disease and Drew's body has already rejected
  3.  He is on the last and 4th drug that is available at this time and
  because it is so rare the demand for the drug is low.  The medication
  he is on now comes from Switzerland, the only place it is made.  The
  doctor orders it through a lab in New Jersey, it is then
  mailed directly to Drew. This medication is not available through a pharmacy. Because of the low demand, the cost for Drew's medication is
  approximately $11,000 per/month.  Medical Insurance and grants pay a
  portion of the entire cost of the drug, so Drew is faced with finding
  funding to make up the balance.  This disease has been an incredible
  financial strain on Drew and his wife Val, who have been married for
  four years. With this medication comes side effects that he must
  manage.  Drew has met this challenge with his usual strength of
  determination, peace of soul, his faith in God and warm and loving demeanor. Drew is very grateful for the prayers and financial support people
  have shown him in the past.  Financially, the importance of any
  monetary gifts cannot be overstated.  It has allowed him to pay for
  the medication to keep him alive.  From a faith viewpoint, he cannot
  thank you all enough for your prayers.  He knows from experience that
  prayer works.  During this last year when weeks of side effects have
  kept him in bed unable to work, he felt your love and prayers.",https://fundrazr.com/exjqd
"1,442",Help Us Make Ireland's Dream a Reality!,U.S. Dollar,,of $500k goal,20,"Hello, we are Megan and Mark. Over three years ago Megan gave birth
  to our beautiful baby girl, Ireland. However, during birth, an
  umbilical cord prolapse resulted in Ireland having cererbal palsy. She
  spent the first 7 weeks of life in the hospital, and we waitied
  anxiously to take her home to her older brothers. This was our first real world experience with cerebral palsy. Many
  people we talk to today don't even know what cerebral palsy is.
  Cerebral palsy is a variable type of brain injury that affects people
  in many different ways. Some children are only slightly affected,
  while others are permamently disabled, wheelchair-bound, and need
  constant attendant care. Cerebral palsy makes a huge impact on the family dynamic. Not only
  are many cerebral palsy families financially dessimated by this
  disease, but they are also stressed emotionally and physically. There are no treatments out there that are covered by insurance to
  treat or reverse cererbal palsy. However, there are many, many
  therapies available worldwide that improve cerebral palsy, and can
  have significant impacts on quality of life. Unfortunately, most of
  these therapies are difficult to obtain due to lack of insurance
  coverage and travel costs. We were lucky enough to discover and utilize many of these therapies
  for Ireland, and have seen dramatic improvements in her since using
  these therapies. We truly believe that no child with cerebral palsy
  should have his or her treatment options limited by his or her
  parent's financial status. Out of this belief, Ireland's Dream was born. Ireland's Dream is to establish a medical center that is fully
  dedicated to the treatment of people with cerebral palsy and their
  families. This Center will have the latest in treatment technologies
  that people all over the world are using for cerebral palsy, available
  under one roof. These therapies include hyperbaric oxygen, ozone
  therapy, Cuevas Medek therapy, scoliosis treatment, and vibration
  therapy. Other necessary therapies will include family counseling,
  diet/nutritional interventions, feeding therapy, assistive device
  training, and more. Our goal is to make cerebral palsy synonymous with Ireland's Dream.
  Please help us make Ireland's Dream come true for patients all over
  the country who are suffering from the debilitating disease. We thank you greatly for any support you can provide.",https://fundrazr.com/f13EF1

240,Jessica's MS alternate treatment,U.S. Dollar,,of $22k goal,3,"1. Hi, My name is Alfonso Velazquez, I'm from Mexico city and I'm
  married to Jessica Maury. We went dating for 10 years and then married
  in 2009. I'm a digital marketer and  a wedding photographer and she is
  a dentist with specialty in orthodontics. 2. When we were 1 year into our marriage Jessica was diagnosed with
  MS because she started to get vertigo and went tired pretty quickly.
  Things escalated fast and by the next year the was on a wheelchair. So
  we started looking for treatment, fortunately we eventually found a
  drug that does very well with her, she changed all her alimentation
  habits and with therapy she walked again, with difficulty but can do
  must of the tasks and have mostly a normal life. 3. The money is because the drug is about $4000 USD monthly (is
  called Gilenya /Fingolimod) and plus the therapies and other drugs for
  symptoms things are getting harder for us, also she suffers from a lot
  of spasticity and only canavis treatment can help her with that, the
  problem is the closest place for her to get it is in the united states
  in California, so we need funds for that also. 4. We are looking for this alternative as a new option for us to keep
  going with the best life quality we can get, to make her believe that
  even if things are complicated there's always a way to confront the darkness. 5. We want to ask for your support and to really offer you that
  anytime you come to Mexico city come with us so we can get you to know
  the city maybe Jessica can check your teeth and I can do some cool
  portraits of you and your family. We know there are lots of people out
  there in need of help and our case may not be the hardest one, but we
  try to also help who ever needs it. so hopefully with your help and
  support we can create a solid chain of favors. Thanks.",https://fundrazr.com/f1GRT4
"6,826",Help Russell to speak again,Pound Sterling,,of £4k goal,197,"I'm raising money for my brother, Russell. Following a stroke 18
    months ago he has aphasia and is no longer able to speak. The NHS
    have been giving him speech therapy and he has made progress.
    However, now the NHS have stopped therapy so I am raising money to
    help pay for ongoing private speech therapy.  (I must add the NHS
    have been amazing, but have limited resource in Russell's area to
    support him further). Every penny you donate will go towards his rehabilitation, we
    are confident he can speak again. Russell is 36, his story is shocking and extraordinary - the
    doctors and specialist do not know what caused any of it.... Aged 23 Russell had a huge heart attack. He'd been windsurfing
    after work. Fit, healthy and very active the Dr's did not know what
    caused it to happen. He rang me during his heart attack, asking
    where our mum was, I told him he needed to ring 999. He survived, but one chamber of his heart was effectively dead.
    It took a year but he made a full recovery and got back to work,
    windsurfing, kitesurfing, cycling and more. In the 10th year after his heart attack Russell spent the year
    fund raising for the British Heart Foundation and raised a target of
    £10,000, the charity’s largest single fundraiser that year. 12 years after the heart attack, aged 35 with a clean bill of
    health and completely signed off by the Drs, he had a stroke. This time he was at work. The receptionist saw it happen and her
    quick actions probably saved his life. This was 2 months after
    Russell got married. Russell sustained huge damage to the brain. He lost all
    movement, speech and some memory. His movement and memory has
    eventually returned but his speech has not. The parts of the brain
    that control his speech are dead and will not regenerate. The rest
    of his brain is now learning those functions but the recovery
    process is long and incredibly hard. Imagine if you can, waking up and not being able to speak. Every
    day. His wife is amazing. With no speech Russell can’t work. He can’t
    drive for 12 months. Rachel supports him through a single income,
    has learnt how to communicate with him, is his interpreter and has
    been instrumental into his recovery. What a start to married life,
    they still haven’t been on a honeymoon! Luckily Russell has made a very good physical recovery. He is
    fitter than most people I know. Addicted to sport. He doesn’t flinch
    at 100 mile bike ride, he kitesurfs, surfs and windsurfs and is
    widely known as an athlete. But he can’t speak. So please help raise some money for Russell, every penny counts.
    He has had a rough ride and your support won’t go unnoticed. I’ll be participating in various cycling events over the summer
    all aimed at raising money for Russell. For every mile I cycle in
    these events I’ll donate £1. Thanks for your support, Russell, Pete and the rest of the Hanford’s.",https://fundrazr.com/a181G4

"9,146",Ride to Give - Supporting Cezar's Cancer Journey,U.S. Dollar,,of $9k goal,444,"On Sunday, May 21st, 2017, six members of Team Ride to Give participated in Ironman 70.3 Chattanooga on
    behalf 3-year-old Cezar Maldonado. They were: Kevin Baxter 2166 * Beth Berger 715 Bill Halstead 619 * Morgan Hendricks 540 David Nazaroff 687 * Carol Zrybko 1640 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ And on Saturday, May 21st, Leigh Roberts Duquette participated in the Dina LaVigna Breath of Life
        Ventura Triathlon . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ On July 12th, 2013, David and Rebecca Maldonado of Dayton, TN, along
  with big brother Izaiah, welcomed baby Cezar into their family.  Life
  for the Maldonados was wonderfully full and felt perfect until May of
  2016 when for no apparent reason Cezar began limping.  His first
  hospital stay was on May 19th, 2016 where he had three x-rays, an MRI,
  and fluid removed from his hip, knee, and ankle. Cezar was
  subsequently sent home, and his parents were given no definitive
  answers as to why their sweet toddler was limping. They returned to
  his primary care physician a few weeks later when they were told
  Cezar’s blood work came back abnormal and that his liver and spleen
  were enlarged. Cezar was directly admitted to the hematology/oncology unit at Children’s Hospital at
    Erlanger in Chattanooga where his parents were told their
    3-year-old had pre-b cell Acute Lymphoblastic
      Leukemia (ALL) which has a survival rate of 95%. In a
  child with ALL, too many stem cells become lymphoblasts, B
  lymphocytes, or T lymphocytes. These cells are cancer (leukemia)
  cells. The leukemia cells do not work like normal lymphocytes and are
  not able to fight infection very well. Also, as the number of leukemia
  cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for
  healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This may
  lead to infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. Cezar received blood and
  platelets and had a port placed so he could begin chemotherapy
  treatments. During the port placement surgery on June 9th, Cezar had
  heart rate complications causing this relatively simple operation to
  take longer than expected. Cezar came out of surgery with a chest tube
  and had to recover in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for two days. Following this surgery, he was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome .
  In Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, an extra electrical pathway
  between the heart's upper and lower chambers causes a rapid heartbeat.
  This additional pathway is present at birth and relatively rare. How
  often a rapid heart rate occurs varies depending on the person. Some
  individuals with WPW syndrome have only a few episodes of rapid heart
  rate. Others may have the rapid heart rate once or twice a week or
  more. Also, there may be no symptoms at all, so like Cezar, WPW is
  found only when a heart test is done for another reason. After his first chest tube was removed, Cezar had complications which
  led to another surgery to remove fluid that had built up around his
  heart and lung. This meant more chest tubes and another PICU stay.
  This second hospital stay lasted nine days, and Cezar received chemo,
  a lumbar puncture, blood and platelets three times, three abdominal
  x-rays, 14 chest x-rays, a lymph node scan, an EKG, and echo and a
  bone marrow aspirate. Cezar’s parents were shocked when the
    results from the bone marrow aspirate changed his diagnosis from
    Pre-B cell ALL to Philadelphia+ Pre-B cell ALL, a form of leukemia
    that only has a 30% survival rate. Their hearts sank with
  fear for their young son but were told that if he uses the medication Gleevec every day it could increase his survival
  rate to 70%. Cezar now takes Gleevec every day, through a feeding tube
  that was placed because he could not take this strong medication by
  mouth without throwing up. One of the complications Cezar has suffered from his time spent
  confined to a hospital bed is the loss of range of motion in his
  ankles. His muscle mass decreased so much so that he could not even
  stand, let alone walk. Cezar started physical therapy and for many
  months had to use braces and a walker to get around. With continued
  physical therapy, Cezar has increased his range of motion and his
  overall strength. Cezar has been in treatment for less than a year and still has a long
  road ahead of him battling ALL. He typically spends around two weeks
  per month in the hospital, which has taken an enormous financial toll
  on his family’s finances. His father, David, is a custodian at the Tennessee Valley Authority in Chattanooga while
  his mother, Rebecca, attends to Cezar’s health issues. It has been a
  rough year, and they are behind on bills and have many out of pocket
  medical expenses. This is where Ride to Give has offered to step in and offer
    the Maldonado family our support.  On Sunday, May 21st, six members
    of Team Ride to Give will participate in Ironman 70.3 Chattanooga on
    behalf of Cezar. They will proudly battle the half-Ironman race

535,Colorblind dude wants to cook and drive safely,U.S. Dollar,,of $499 goal,12,"Hello everyone. My name is Tyler. I am colorblind. Being colorblind
  is not very much fun. Do you how much stuff is in color? A lot. I live
  by myself, which is very nice. Sometimes I like to cook, which is also
  nice. But I can't see how well-cooked anything is, that is not so
  nice. I think my cat might be able to see colors, but she is not very
  useful most of the time so I don't think I can rely on her to help me cook. This is my cat, Juanita, who is cute, I'll admit, but not what I
    would call a team player. Driving also sucks. If there's a blinking single light and I'm
  driving towards it I don't know what color it is. Sometimes I'm lucky
  and there's someone in front of me who will either drive through it or
  stop, and I follow their lead. But if I'm in the lead of a bunch of
  cars or by myself, what am I supposed to do? Most of the time I stop
  anyway, but if there's a car behind me when I think the light is a
  yellow and I stop for what they think is no reason, they get very mad
  and honk. There are a lot of other reasons to not want to be colorblind. Some
  people have very pretty eyes, I can see blue ones and brown ones and
  that is it. I have dated some people with green eyes, and my mom has
  green eyes too. I'd like to be able to see green eyes. Red is supposed to be a beautiful color, I'd like to see that too. I
  would also like to not have to answer questions from people about what
  color things are once they find out I'm colorblind. The answer to all
  of those questions is always: I'm not sure, I'm colorblind, please
  leave me alone. But apparently this is a rude answer to give, so I
  play along. I'd like to not have to do that anymore. If I get these glasses I'll take a video of me wearing them for the
  first time so we can all feel good about helping a disabled person
  because helping disabled people is a really nice thing to do. Maybe
  I'll cry in the video because everything is so pretty. People cry in
  those videos a lot, you know? It'll be like an old man in a chair
  looking at some balloons and he'll get all teary-eyed and someone will
  say Awww from behind the camera and it's usually pretty cute.
  Plus, like I said, there are always balloons in those videos and I
  want to know if EnChroma sends balloons with the glasses, because
  that'd be pretty neat if they did, but I don't know. Help me partake in capitalism by letting me see why red is used so much. Anyway, if you all could give a few dollars to support a guy who
  would really like to know what the fuss is all about with colors, I'd
  much appreciate it. I'd like a pair of these things that are in my
  prescription so I wouldn't have to choose between seeing colors and
  seeing anything at all. That will run me $499 before tax. If I could
  not have to pay the full $499 plus tax I think that'd be pretty swell. Thank you all and enjoy your day. -Tyler",https://fundrazr.com/d1FtS9
349,Enchroma glasses for Matt,U.S. Dollar,,of $349 goal,4,"WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color
  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color
  accuracy. Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are not
      a cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type and
      extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses are
      estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of red-green
      color vision deficiency – prospective users are encouraged to take
      our online color vision test to assess the likelihood of efficacy. Enchroma does not
      endorse use of the glasses to pass occupational screening tests
      such as the Ishihara test. For more information please read the FAQs , learn about the Enchroma technology and story , or contact customer support . Check out these reactions",https://fundrazr.com/91FXab
"4,285",Kerrera Tea Garden Zika-GBS Appeal,Pound Sterling,,of £5k goal,141,"Twelve times a minute, 24/7 this father gently inflates the black bag
  that breathes oxygen into his son. If he were to stop for more than a
  few minutes, the paralysed child dies. This is brutal reality of
  Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), a disease most of us have never even
  heard of. I certainly hadn't heard of it until summer 2006, where out of the
  blue, while living in Prague, I was left in similar dire straights as
  the child above except I was lucky to have access some of the best
  care available. Of course medical care is only one aspect of dealing
  with the devestating effects of GBS, my support network of friends and
  family were equally vital to to my lengthy journey of recovery. GBS is triggered by infections and affects 100,000 people per annum
  worldwide of all ages, sexes, religions and races. Right now, the ZIKA
  virus that is spreading like wildfire across the world, especially
  Latin America is triggering thousands of extra cases of GBS that are
  going virtually unnoticed on the global health scale. The harsh reality for many of the people affected by this current
  epidemic, like the poor child in the picture, is that they will not
  have access to the great medical care that we in the UK are used to
  and in some cases this inevitably leads to death. Last year I was lucky enough to marry my amazing wife Aideen. Like
  many of my nearest and dearest friends, we met through the shared love
  of Brazilian music. For over 15 years we have played in various bands
  and taken an interest in Brazilian culture from Samba in Rio to the
  Marcacatu and Forro of Pernambuco in the North East. We managed to
  fulfil a long term dream for us both this year by visiting Brazil for
  our honeymoon. I expected the trip to be full of excitement and adventure but I did
  not expect to see increasing headlines and warnings about Zika and its
  link to my rare illness! It seemed like a crazy coincidence
  and I shrugged it off until my Facebook thread was filled with videos
  of my old consultant on BBC and SKY News talking about the terrible
  effects of GBS. After sending him a small message to say what a great
  job he was doing I found out he was to land in Recife, the epicentre
  of the epidemic, the day we were leaving. The omens were building! It's been ten years since I discovered GBS by accident and one
  hundred years since Georges Guillain and Jean-Alexandre Barré the two
  scientists/doctors made the important initial discovery during the
  Battle of the Somme. For many reasons this year seems like a good year
  to try to help those who need it the most. There are clinics in Brazil
  and Columbia that are desperate for financial help and I promise that
  all monies raised will go to those who can make a difference and not
  get soaked up by the sometime corrupt nature of the governments that
  so far have been unable to help their own people. The worldwide Centenary Symposium on GBS is being held in Glasgow on
  Friday 24 June 2016, 100 miles south-east from our Tea Garden on
  Kerrera. As a finale to our fundraising drive, we promise to donate
  100% of the profits from the cafe on the previous day and I will
  announce the total amount raised via Skype live to the meeting in
  Glasgow. This broadcast will be streamed around the world. In the
  meantime, we hope that those with a little to spare can make a small
  donation that will help those most in need.",https://fundrazr.com/716nC7

She hasn't been able to work for the last 3 weeks and the hospital bill is going to be crazy expensive since she does not have health insurance. Her Church and my family are doing everything we can to help but her rent will be do soon and the Hospital Bill as well. If you find it in your heart and wallet to donate, please do. Even if its a single dollar.I figured if all my 679 facebook friends donate at least $5 each that would give her $3,395 to cover her rent and make a slight dent on the Hospital bill. Her rent isn't much, but the hospital bill is will be crazy.

"15,597",Eveolution,Pound Sterling,,of £20k goal,126,"In July 2014, 2-year-old Eve McGonigle was diagnosed with an
  extremely rare and life-threatening brain tumour called Ependymoma.
  After weeks of mis-diagnosis, Eve was extremely ill, struggling to
  walk, talk or even eat. The life was sucked out of her and it was
  agonising to see the once mischevious and adorable toddler struggling
  to survive. Eve's condition drastically deteriorated and after a visit
  to the Borders General Hospital was rushed to Edinburgh's Sick Kids
  for emergency treatment after a brain scan determined the unthinkable.
  This was truly devastating and soul destroying for Eve's family who
  could only rally around and pray for a miracle, whilst Eve lay almost
  unrecognisable in a ward bursting with other young children fighting
  for their lives. Upon arriving at the hospital, Eve was taken in and cared for by the
  magical staff and nurses of Ward 7. The procedures and life-saving
  treatment that Eve required were terrifying for both Eve and her
  family, however the miraculous nurses and medical staff were
  constantly on hand 24 hours a day to help with their calming and
  loving nature, somehow helping to make the six week stint in a stark
  hospital bed bearable. These people dedicate their lives to ensure the
  young children that enter the ward have the very best chance of making
  it out in full health, so we want to give something back. EVEolution has been set up to help the staff and patients of Ward 7
  to improve the facilities on the ward to allow children fighting this
  deadly disease and their families find some sort of comfort and solace
  throughout this stressful time. If you would like to help us make a difference we would be forever
  grateful knowing that with your generous support we have made a
  difference to help future children like Eve and their families having
  to battle through this terrifying experience. When you are smacked in
  the face with a heartbreaking matter such as Eve's we know it would
  make a difference to find a little more comfort in an alien environment. We will keep you up to date with projects on our twitter and Facebook page. Thank you, thank you, thank you. @eveolution facebook.com/eveolutionUK",https://fundrazr.com/Eveolution

600,Medical Fund: Help Ease My Sister's Family Costs,U.S. Dollar,,of $7.8k goal,6,"Hello, my name is Gabrielle Jones Price. Those of you who know my
  sister, Wendy will know me as Gabby. My hope is that those who don't
  know me or my sister continue to read on. No one is a stranger when it comes to suffering or struggles in life
  -- it is the one thing we all have in common as a human family and
  that is why I am here to ask for assistance in my family's time of need. Wendy's husband has been suffering with the sudden onset of a severe
  health issue, diagnosed as possible Crohn's disease. No one seems to
  know with certainty why he has lost a startling amount of weight --
  enough that I have been asked not to share recent photos of him. Even
  the precious photos of them together with my niece going to her first dance. I've done fundraising for activists, organizations and friends in
  need. I sit here heartsick for them and want to turn this feeling of
  helplessness into helpfullness. My sister's family is beautiful, fun-loving, respected and active. My
  brother-in-law was especially active before his diagnosis: playing
  tennis, traveling for work in sports media, boating, swimming and golf
  to name a few of his favorite things. He has been instructed to bed
  rest for several weeks. As a sportsman, this is like being benched or
  put in a penalty box. Unable to stand for long periods, he's also not
  allowed to work. This alone I'm certain is a major source of
  frustration for him. He's a great cook, a terrific father, adores my sister and we share a
  love for sarcasm and humor. This illness is incredibly challenging for
  all of them. It is difficult with the stress of bills mounting, no
  insurance and trying to keep my niece in good spirits approaching her
  birthday. [She's on the autism scale and a bouyant ray of light to all
  of us. For Aunt Gabby, this is as much for her wellbeing as her parents.] My big sister always watched over me when I came along. Full of
  advice [often when I didn't ask for it...big sisters are like that]
  but I've always been able to count on her whenever the chips were down
  and the need was dire. She shows up. I want to show up for her. She probably won't like that I'm doing
  this but I know what it's like to be in a difficult place, to swallow
  pride and ask for help when it's most needed. And it is most needed
  for her family. So I am calling on my friends, her friends, his
  friends, all collegues and any angel donor that can help fill this
  need. Let's insure they're focused on his best of health instead of
  financial needs that often create undue stress on a family. I want to
  suprise them by lifting at least some of these burdens. I'll be offering incentives as we go...like a silent auction of sorts. My sister and I do things a little differently, butt heads on
  occassion but laugh easily at ourselves as much as each other. We were
  raised in a family of Beatlemaniacs, but her passion for their music
  and message she carried into her work is what I'd like to return: All you need is Love. Money helps, though! You may chose to donate any amount without
  participating in the auction. Updates are forthcoming and any family
  members, friends or colleagues are welcome to participate by sharing
  stories, anectdotes, etc. These will cheer them after the fundraiser
  is over and during his recovery from surgery. [If you're unable to
  donate but wish to offer a gift/service for auction, please contact me directly and we'll
  figure out a way to make it work.] Thank you all for helping this little sister's effort to pay it
  forward for her big sister. One Love ~ Gabby",https://fundrazr.com/beatle_blessings

  graphic artist around the world for the past 10 years... I am
  currently living in Cambodia and up until recently this has been a
  dream life: travelling; meeting amazing people; learning languages and
  building bridges through music and art. I like to inspire people with
  my energy and positivity on and off the stage. Usually it is a tough
  but rewarding life, as musicians and artists know... it's about
  finding the next gig! Recently I have had some health issues which
  caused a collapse for me onstage. After spending a lot of time being
  misdiagnosed, I finally found a great set of doctors here in the
  Kingdom of Cambodia, who have their patients best interest at heart.
  When i could no longer make money by playing music, I used my graphic
  design to make some side cash, however rainy season has just started
  here and one of the first victims was my computer. This has left me
  with no real way of being able to fund myself. Unfortunately now all
  of this has exhausted all of my funds and I am not in a position to be
  able to pay for the medical services that I so desperately need. I'm
  not one to ask for help if I can do things myself, but now I am need
  of help and that is what I am desperately asking for. I have a stomach
  ulcer caused by h. pylori infection which after a triple antibiotic
  treatment doesn't seem to be healing. On top of that I have recurring
  episodes of tachycardia ( very fast heart beat - 130bpm.) I need to
  raise about $1000 in total to pay for medical expenses such as
  upcoming heart tests and an endoscopy to check my stomach, as well as
  any medication needed. I have been stuck on my back for over 6 months
  now, and I really am struggling with this as I usually am full of
  energy and giving time to help others in need. Please, if you can help
  me at this low part in my life story, it would mean so much to me. My
  partner Darya is working as hard as she can to provide us both with
  food, rent and basic medicines.But as it is rainy season now, work
  isn't as avaiable. I dont really need help to replace my material
  things, I can use my own energy to do this. But I really need help to
  get on my feet, get better and get my energy back to replace them. I
  know that all I need is some medical help and I will be back at it
  again... that is my natural way. I am a fighter, but sometimes
  fighters need help - and that is what I am asking for.",https://fundrazr.com/savesimonstays

    of Hillsborough, NJ and I am blessed to say that I have married into
    one of the most generous, loving and selfless families on the
    planet. It is exactly for this reason that I am reaching out to all
    of you, my friends, relatives, co-workers and generous strangers to
    help support a member of my family. A 3-year-old boy named Andy. Andy was born on June 18, 2013 with polysyndactyly, resulting in
    extreme deformation of his four limbs, and numerous other health complications. As a three-year-old, Andy has already undergone five, and is
      now on his sixth surgery: Three in his hands, one in his
    foot, one in his testicle, one to amputate the first of both feet,
    with more to come. During his first surgery on September 9, 2013, doctors
        were able to separate the fused bones in his hand and create
        three individual fingers. The second surgery on April 26, 2014, Andy
      had both feet operated on, only to have complications
        during the procedure impair any progress. The third surgery on February 20, 2014 sought
      to operate the undescended testicle. The fourth surgery on April 15, 2015 removed extra
        bones from his hands. The fifth surgery to date was on October 1, 2015, where his
        hands were finally separated into five fingers. The sixth and
          most recent surgery took place, September 8th, to remove the
          first of both of his feet. Though these are huge strides, the follow-up and treatment plan
    to address Andy’s severely deformed and clubbed feet has become
    extremely complex and thus far, surgically unsuccessful to
    physicians from the National Children’s Hospital of Costa Rica.
    Andy’s amazing team of doctors has worked with other physicians from
    The United States, Mexico and Argentina without any success due to
    the complexity, peculiarity and severity of Andy’s case. Fortunately, on June 21, 2016, orthopedic surgeons from France
    arrived to the National Children’s Hospital. These specialists evaluated and
        examined Andy’s feet and concluded that the best option is to amputate below his ankles so
        that Andy would be able to walk in the future with the aid of prosthesis. Andy was slated to undergo his
      first amputation in December 2016, however, he was able to be
      moved up and is had his first amputation on September 8th, 2016. This surgical procedure will
      amputate the right foot. After his recovery, they will proceed to
      amputate the left foot. From that point moving
    forward, Andy will require prosthetic legs. However, Andy will grow out of the
          prosthetics every 12 months, requiring a new pair every year
          until growth has halted. The cost of the prosthetics is high, but Andy will be able
      to walk, run, and jump like a normal child. This little boy
      deserves the chance to live a normal childhood just like other
      boys his age, not worry if he will ever be able to walk. Please,
      find it in your hearts to donate whatever you can for Andy. Join

"4,038",Zach Branson's Medical Fundraiser,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,25,"Zachary Branson was born with a liver disease known as biliary
  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai
  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the
  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may
  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai
  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a
  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is
  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for
  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to
  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent
  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually
  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not
  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 30 years old, Zach has
  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times
  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in
  2006 from liver and kidney failure due to alcoholism. Zach cannot work
  a ""normal"" job anymore due to complications that arise from
  this disease. He is currently in the process of fighting for

858,Please Help Me To Pay For Medical Costs,Pound Sterling,,of £2k goal,32,"My name is Sandra... Day by day, I grow more convinced that ECT is not an effective
  treatment, and that it does little more than provide a brief respite
  from depression, followed by despair and hopelessness . . . and
  potential damage to the brain."" Juli Lawrence '' healthyplace.com ect.org The doctors tell me I’m suffering from a progressive degenerative
  disease of the brain. They say it’s like chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), but that
  can only be diagnosed after someone dies so they can’t know for sure. I’m fundraising in the hopes of being able to seek a second medical
  opinion, and, ideally, private medical care and relief from the
  intense pain. I’ve struggled for many years with depression. I don’t remember
  giving birth to my oldest son, or to my youngest last year. I was too
  sick to look after him when he was born. He was taken into care before
  they let his father have him. I became quite unwell and was eventually put into a psychiatric ward.
  The tablets seemed to work in the beginning. Then I was put on
  #venlafaxine (brand name #Effexor) which worked for a while. But I
  became unwell again. The doctors suggested electro convulsive therapy
  (ECT), or shock treatment, while I was still taking venlafaxine. They
  said that I’d benefit from it. They didn’t explain the potential
  serious side effects. My last ECT session was over three months ago. After more than 16
  treatments I’ve been left with severe memory loss, brain damage, and
  nerve damage. It seems like I’m getting worse, starting to forget how
  to do the most basic things. The doctors refuse to send me for a CT
  scan. They say it would damage more cells and cause more brain damage.
  When I asked to see a neurologist they also refused that request. I’m determined to fight this for my children, myself, and anyone else
  who may have been hurt by ECT. I began doing research. It seems as
  though patients taking venlafaxine should not get ECT. OOPS! The good
  news is that there might be hope in the form of a stem cell
  transplant. I won’t know if that could work for me unless I can see a
  neurologist privately. Can you please help me pay for private medical treatment? I know most
  of us are struggling, and I don’t mean to sound like that shop . . .

"10,025",Helping Jacob ~ Ewing's Sarcoma Sucks!,U.S. Dollar,,of $2.5k goal,77,"Thank you for taking the time to visit this page in honor of Jake. 
  The Conde family is extremely grateful for each and every one of you.
    The saying "" It takes a village"" is definitely true in
  this situation. How does a family properly thank someone for the
  things that they have done to help out during difficult times?  You
  need to know how much all the prior well wishes, positive thoughts,
  prayers, donations, helping with meals, helping out with Lucas, gifts
  for Jake, time spent together, and friendship has meant to the Conde
  family - THANK YOU! Here we go again... Where do I even begin?  Honestly, it's really
  difficult to gather thoughts, considering so much has gone on the past
  77 weeks.  As most of you know, Jake was diagnosed with Ewing's
  Sarcoma in his left femur bone in April of 2015, when he was 9 years
  old. To keep it short, it was a very long year with many nights in the
  hospital, multiple biopsies, surgeries, chemo, lab/diagnostic testing,
  physical therapy etc.  It was a nightmare, but they got through it -
  or so they thought.  Shortly after his year long cancer treatment
  ended, Jake started having pain in his shoulder and losing weight, so
  they took him in for testing.  Then came the devastating news, which
  was even worse than the first time around.  Not only was his cancer
  back, they were told that Jake had 6 metastatic tumors. Cancer sucks!
  Sarcoma sucks! Many of you have emailed or left messages for Steph, Roger, and
  myself asking what you can do to help. First and foremost, for those
  of you who pray, please keep Jake in your daily prayers.  Jake has a
  birthday coming up, he turns 11 on October 22nd.  If you would like to
  send him a card or write him a note, you can mail it directly to his
  home, or contact me (my number is below) for more information. For
  those of you who would like to make a small donation, that would be
  great too. I know that they are spending thousands of dollars out of
  pocket each month. Currently Jake has had five in-patient chemo treatments (each 5 days
  long), and goes back in on Monday 10/17 for his sixth treatment.  A
  recent scan showed only 2 of his 6 tumors as active - this is good
  news!  The current plan is to give Jake 18 months of chemo - that's
  the bad news!  The chemo is taking a toll on him, the drugs are very
  hard on your body, it's been tough! In addition to chemo, the Conde family strongly believes in an
  alternative and holistic approach this time around; they believe
  that the chemo alone will not cure their son.  Jake is eating all
  organic and non-gmo foods, using essential oils, cannabis oil,
  juicing, drinking alkaline water & special teas, taking
  supplements... You name it, they're doing it! What the Conde family is going through is impossible to comprehend. 
  We've watched Jake go from being such a happy, funny, spirited
  child who was so full of life, to fighting for his life. What are the
  days during chemo and just after chemo like for them now?  At times
  Jake is screaming/crying in pain, has anxiety/fear of upcoming
  procedures/testing, vomits throughout the day, spends most of the day
  on the couch or in bed with no energy, is up sick most of the night,
  feels depressed, angry, and lonely at times. It stinks! It's really
  tough to see him/them go through this!  Roger and Steph are up around
  the clock caring for Jake, it's 24/7!  But, they continue to stay
  strong, believe in miracles, and have hope!  Losing is not an option! During Jake's first year of treatment Jake watched a lot of Adam
  Sandler movies in the hospital, Stephanie and Roger expressed how
  those movies helped them get through the awful hospital stays. 
  Laughter soothes the soul!  If you have any really good funny movie
  suggestions that are appropriate for an 11 year old, please make suggestions. The best therapy for Jake and family right now is for them to get out
  of the house (when Jake is feeling well), or to have company; they
  love to be around friends and family every chance they get. Even if
  it's for a short time.  Don't be afraid to reach out! We are all thankful for every minute, hour or glimpse of happiness
  that Jake feels. When he smiles, we all smile! Thank you for your concern and continued support.

"8,071",Have a Little Faith in Love(Team Talib),U.S. Dollar,,of $50k goal,112,"A mother’s first fear is a Childs first scrape and boo boo on
    the knee. A mother’s first tear is when they say, ""I love you
    mommy."" Myself and my husbands biggest fear was our worst
    reality for our 22 month old son. Talib disappeared when our backs
    were turned for a second. On March 1, 2014 our beautiful baby boy,
    full of life, love, and charisma was found face up in the backyard
    of our family pool. My husband asked me, ""Babe is Talib with
    you?"" I said ""No, I thought he was with you."" Our
    little adventurer loved to go in his uncles room to throw things
    everywhere; so that’s the first place I checked. Meanwhile, my
    husband checked the garage, thinking maybe someone went out and
    didn’t shut the door properly. I checked the bathroom because our
    little tiker loved to throw qtips in the toilet. So, I was sure he
    would be in there; he wasn’t!  I heard a loud scream like no other
    that came from my husband. He yelled ""OH MY GOD!!! OH MY
    GOD!!!"" I yelled frantically saying ""What!"" ""What!"" I was hoping he fell, got a scrape and was bleeding terribly
    and would need stitches. My heart was racing. I felt a bulge in my
    throat. I then walked towards the French doors facing the back of
    the house that were always so beautiful because it engaged the pool
    in such a way that it was enticing; even for me as it was for our
    little one. My baby was lifeless and blue floating at the top of the
    water. My husband jumped in and pulled him out, we were jumping
    around screaming and crying, I was ready to except my child on the
    ground lifeless and blue with an extended stomach and no heart beat.
    While my 7yr old son Isaiah, who is Talib's older brother screamed
    in the background of my clouded thoughts ""IS MY BABY BROTHER
    DEAD?"" ""HE CANT SWIM MY BABY BROTHER IS DEAD!!!!"" My
    husband’s cousins were at the house; one of them took Isaiah inside
    the house, the other was on the phone with 911. Everything was
    moving so fast, but a calm came over me. I kneeled down on my knees
    and I began to give my child mouth to mouth resuscitation. The calm
    was God telling me not to give up. I got on the phone with dispatch;
    I'm sure the women on the other end had heard the  scream. When I
    was placed on the phone she kept saying, ""I don’t want to speak
    with you, your'e too emotional."" I said to her, ""Maam this
    is my baby we're talking about!"" ""I am ready to take
    instructions."" She said to press down on the chest three times
    and then blow in the mouth. I was scared because before I had gotten
    on the phone with her I was just pressing on the chest and blowing
    as much air as I could as the water gargled out of his lifeless
    body. Before I could even follow the dispatch instructions, the EMT
    arrived in record timing. EMT was there giving him immediate oxygen
    and pushing epinephrine to restart his heart. They told my husband
    and I to follow after them. That was the journey that we started on
    March 1, 2014 that changed the course of our little toddlers life.
    We are asking from the pit of our stomach to the Faith in our
    hearts that your loving hands and humble spirits find the time and
    generosity to donate whatever  you have from a penny to infinity
     for Talib's medical care and expenses. His heart beat came back so
    I know he wants to fight. Please help us in Talib's fight to recover
    and be stronger and better than he ever was before. HAVE A LITTLE

"5,090",Update on Jim Gaffney and Request for Help,U.S. Dollar,,of $6k goal,40,"On August 3rd, Jim was un-expectantly hospitalized after severe chest pain and shortness of breath while enroute to a concert in Central Park. Immediately, the doctors recognized symptoms of a heart attack and diagnosed his significant cardiac failure in two areas of his heart. He underwent emergency heart catheterization to open his main coronary artery that was blocked 99%. This procedure saved his life. At the time, they also found another artery in the back of his heart that was occluded 95%. Instead of fixing that during his first hospital stay they wanted to be sure his heart was strong enough and required him to rest for a several weeks first. His cardiologist declared him medically unable to continue his current work as a Marriage and Family Therapy Associate / Drug and Alcohol counselor near his current home in Bethpage, a Long Island suburb of NYC. He is currently at home resting, and considering God s wake-up call on his life while awaiting this second procedure which should be done in mid-September. The timing of this incident left him in quite a predicament financially as his medical coverage insuring his care through his MFT Masters ended soon after graduation (May 2013) and expected coverage with current employer had not yet begun. He had also exhausted his savings after paying for two years of schooling and his recent move to his own small studio apartment. Thankfully it seems that the hospital and his former insurance are finalizing arrangements to cover most expenses of both emergency hospitalization and the medically necessary 2nd procedure. His prognosis for cardiac health and an extended life are very good! It Jim s hope is to add considerably to his 29 years of Christ-centered dedicated ministry. Through the generous aid of family and friends Jim s financial needs have been met for the majority of his August expenses. THANK YOU SO MUCH! The short-term, temporary concern is meet the next 60 days financial needs of his studio apartment rent ($1000), utilities ($150-200), transportation ($250), Rx costs ($600), groceries and ancillary medical expenses.

  acting teacher.  My family and I live in the Seattle area.  This
  campaign is for my daughter Lotus. Lotus is a beautiful, kind, loving woman. She has been diagnosed with breast cancer. She is only 42. Lotus is the mother of 3 and a major bread winner in her household. Lotus had insurance with a company who pulled out of Washington and
  she is no longer covered for her surgeries, chemo, radiation or drug
  treatments.  Her ability to work, cleaning houses for others, will be
  greatly impacted for the year ahead.  This is not work you can do
  while sheltering your system from bacteria and viral infections. Her first surgery was the 20th of March.  Following surgery we took
  her on the family vacation we had planned all year. When we returned,
  she had to have a second surgery before her chemo, radiation and drug
  treatments began.  The second surgery was also not complete so
  following her chemo she will undergo a third before radiation begins.
   She is expected to be in treatment until Thanksgiving. I am hoping to raise money which would allow her to rest and focus on
  getting well and being with her family until her health is restored.
   The ability to continue paying the bills she has always covered,
  groceries, electric, water, insurance and activities for her children
  will help us continue to create a steady home environment for her and
  her younger children as she battles her cancer.  On top of these she
  now has to shoulder the expense of her treatments and surgeries. For anyone not wanting to use an on line format, I am opening an
  account at Key Bank in her name for this purpose.  The account name is
  Standing With Lotus. We appreciate any gift you feel led to share.  Your prayers are
  equally as important and valuable. I will post updates as her
  treatment progresses.  Thank you for your generosity. God Bless.",https://fundrazr.com/11DXv7

  which effects his muscles. Finley got cerebral palsy through lack of
  oxygen to his brain which has resulted in brain damage.  The simple
  things we take for granted Finley struggles with. Finley underwent an operation in Feb 2016 called selective dorsal
  rhizotomy. The surgeon cuts through the spine and cuts off some of the
  stems which are causing Finley's legs to be so stiff. This left him
  with loose legs which were so much easier to move but revealed the
  underlying muscle weakness. Finley is now 6 and able to walk with a
  walking frame although his main way of getting around is in his
  wheelchair or crawling around the house. Our ultimate goal is for
  Finley to be able to walk with sticks ! Finley gets 1 physio session a week on the NHS but he is required to
  do some sort of exercise everyday. He also has 1 swimming lesson a
  week. We have a private Physio who is £60 an hour who he sees once a
  week.  Finley is working so hard for her and as you can imagine it is

"1,505",Service Dog Puppy for disabled rescuer,U.S. Dollar,,of $4.7k goal,28,"This fundraiser is to help raise funds to cover the expenses related
  to obtaining and training a service dog prospect to replace my current
  service dog. As many of my friends and family know, my current service dog
  Sonakih is amazing in every way, she gives 100% all the time, she has
  been the most amazing companion and help to me.  But due to her own
  health, after a scary bought with pneumonia that left her unable to
  help me for several weeks earlier this year, and me having to really
  struggle to do the things she normally assists me with made me realize
  how much I truly need her help, and the harsh reality that I really do
  need a dog that can serve as her backup to assist me during the times
  Sonakih is unable to, as well as do some tasks that due to her health
  and smaller size Sonakih is unsuitable for. Here are the expected expenses related to obtaining and training
  the puppy.  The breeder has generiously offered to donate the puppy,
  but the expenses to get her from Georgia to Utah still need to be
  raised. - Health Certificate, exam, and pre-flight paperwork
  from vet - $75 - Airline approved shipping crate $50 -
  Flight from Atlanta, Georgia to SLC, Utah - $275 - Puppy, basic,
  and advanced service dog training through Side by Side dog training -
  Free through 6 months, and an expected cost average of about $200 per
  month from 6 months to 2 years when she's ready to complete training
  as a service dog, so approx $3600 total.  (This is a very rough
  estimate, because of course she may progress faster or slower then
  average, and need more or less individual sessions ($80/session) then
  what this average cost was figured off of) - Training vest,
  patches, and eventually a specially fitted mobility assistance harness
  for when she's old enough to start mobility training - ~$600 Her breeder has generiously offered to donate the puppy herself,
  I just need to raise the expenses to get her here from Georgia, as
  well as pay for the training that will be needed to get her to fully
  trained service dog status.  It breaks my heart to be needing to train
  another service dog before my current dog is even 3 years old, but due
  to her health and limitations, I feel it's the best for both myself
  and my current service dog.  My service dog will continue to serve me
  until the time this puppy is fully trained and ready for duty, and
  having 2 dogs fully trained to assist me will allow me to give both
  dogs more breaks as needed for whatever reason since it's very
  difficult for me to even do basic things like grocery shopping without
  the assistance of my service dog. Keep in mind I loose about 10% of donations made through
  Fundrazr - If you would like to donate directly to avoid loosing as
  much in fees, you can donate through Paypal to poodle.momma@att.net or paypal.me/poodlemomma   I
  will update the donations made directly to keep the running total accurate. Please help me make this a reality and keep my independance and

883,Ria Fincham NMO Cure & Recovery Fund,,,,,"The Ria Fincham Cure and Recovery Fund Ria’s Story (Condensed version) In July 2012, Ria was experiencing severe back and head pain with
  fever. It quickly progressed to eye pain, unable to urinate, tingling
  in her extremities and paralyzation of her legs. She was rushed to Ventura County Medical Center in Ventura, CA, where
  her condition rapidly grew worse. Emergency room doctors gathered a
  neurologist, infectous disease doctor and several other physicians to
  quickly try to determine what was causing her these serious symptoms.
  They ran a battery of tests and administered a variety of i.v.
  steroids, part chemo and antibiotic medications as they thought it to
  be transverse myelitis after consulting with Mayo Hospital. Incoherent
  and shuddering with a high temperature in the hospital bed that first
  night she was admitted, I climbed in to her bed and held her. I
  thought Lord you laid her in my arms 24 years ago, I will hold her
  while she is alive one last time before you take her from me. I really
  wasn’t sure my little girl was going to make it through the night. All
  I could do was pray and hope the doctors were giving her the right
  treatments and she would pull through. The doctors declared that she
  had Transverse Myelitis a neurological disorder that creates rare
  inflammation, lesions and tissue and nerve damage and demyelation to
  your spinal chord. For 2 weeks in the hospital she was given all the
  treatments to try to restore the function she had lost in her bladder,
  bowel and her paralyzed lower body. Doctors and Therapists were able
  to get her walking again but they were unable to help restore her
  bowel and bladder to function on their own. But with recovery they
  said this would eventually improve. The day she was released she was
  so happy to be going home walking slowly with a walker and looking
  forward to recuperating at home. The worst was yet to come. August 7th 2012, I was summoned by her
  younger sister, to come home quickly as she had had another
  neurological attack only this time, the head pain felt like her head
  was being crushed down into her body and she had severe eye pain. We
  immediately went back to the same hospital and were met with a
  different group of attending doctors. All the same symptoms were back
  except this time it progressed to excrutiating eye and back pain,
  paralyzation of her legs and right arm with her hand curled in and
  frozen. An MRI showed that the lesions had spread to her brain and
  were worse in her spine. As her condition grew graver and had doctors
  stumped, they decided to transport her by ambulance to UCLA for
  further treatment and diagnostic testing. After an extensive barage of tests, (i.e. spinal taps, MRI, CRT, Pet
  Scans, Evoke Potentials and extensive bloodwork) it was the NMO IG-G
  test that came back positive for Neuromyelitis Optica a few days later
  after arriving at UCLA. Because the inflammatory response went in to
  overdrive more of her myelin was stripped from her spinal chord, she
  had longer lesions in her spine and her brain this time. We spent the
  next few months, getting treatment. Little did we know with all the
  countless plasmapherisis, ritux infusion, cortecortesoid treatments,
  etc that the damage had been done and we couldn’t reverse the damage.
  Her vision was spared, no blindness or retina or cornea damage and her
  arm function was restored. To date she has not regained the ability to
  walk and she suffers from bowel and bladder dysfunction, nerve pain,
  depression and fatigue to name a few. Her brain lesions have caused
  her memory loss and other cognitive problems, her dream of finishing
  college is on hold indefinitely. Her fiancé found this too much for
  him to cope with and called off their wedding when she was at UCLA in
  hospital rehab. Prior to her getting ill she had just been laid off
  from her job that was outsourced with countless other jobs in her
  department to a foreign country. Despite all these sad events
  unfolding, she had her tearful moments but was focused on beating this
  disease and fighting on! She is my HERO! Being a single mom, I didn’t
  know how strong of a young woman I had raised along with her younger
  sister, Kai. I’m blessed and honored to be their Mom. We weren’t home free, the complex health system, can shake you up if
  you’ve never been through the process of navigating and advocating for
  your loved one. We had a false sense of security and naïve about
  certain things that can affect the outcome of your loved one’s future
  health. But that’s another topic of discussion in a separate post. Ria
  is alive albeit still fighting this horrid unpredictable disease. Any
  future attacks, God forbid, would leave her with more injurious
  disabilities. We have been simply band aiding the symptoms with
  prescription medications that carry the risk of giving her more
  serious terminal s. diseases. So hear we are 2 years later, despite
  experts having clinical trials on medications that will disarm
  components in cells that reek havoc in your immune system look
  promising, most medicines don’t become available for at least 20
  years. Once they pass all the clinical trials then the FDA will
  finally or maybe approve. What complicates matters most, is that since
  NMO is rare there are only so many patients that become candidates or
  even want to volunteer for these trials. Results are slim and hard to
  compare to other data when your pool of NMO patients is smaller than
  the trials for more widely larger  populations of cancer or HIV
  patients. I applaud the medical experts who continue to do research in
  hopes of making the medicine that will cure NMO. One has stated that
  NMO will be the first autoimmune disease they will cure that exists
  amongst 400+ others. They have the definitive blood test IG-G that has
  the biomarkers for the disease. But the younger you are and if your
  disease has not met the neurodegenerative stage your chances of
  beating it are improved. If we wait 20 years for these medicines or
  the medicine that will cure NMO, Ria will be 46. With her current
  treatment there is no guarantee she won’t have another attack in a
  month, a year or 19 years down the road. Some NMO patients are
  “monophasic” and only have one attack; some have multiple relapsing
  NMO that subjects them to multiple eattacks. But there are no clear
  indicators if you are monophasic or relapsing since the course of the
  disease has no predictable course or stages. We can’t wait 20 years
  and we can’t wait for another attack. NMO has been like a ticking time
  bomb looming in the back of our minds, we have a drill like EMT’s
  waiting for the other shoe to drop. We as a family have to seek
  emergency treatment immediately . It’s no way to live. With the grace of God we were unknowingly searching for a cure and
  came across a patient organization fundraising manager that mentioned
  the work of DIAD.org – Division of Immunotherapy and Autoimmune in
  Diseases in Chicago. How did this escape my radar on all the countless
  late night web searches? I can’t even tell you how many medical pub
  journals online I’ve scoured for answers, a cure. Once we looked into
  the autologous stem cell treatment and what it involves we realized
  this is not for the faint of heart. Ria and I are a team but
  ultimately it was her decision to move forward and reach out to them
  for treatment. She is brave and wants to be clear of this so she can
  look to the future in working on rehab at Project Walk. We hope you will offer your support and donate so we can cover our
  expenses in traveling to the initial meeting with DIAD to see if she
  is a candidate. If she is, we will be staying in Chicago longer
  for the actual treatment. Our household will be on hold but the bills
  won’t be. Our fundraising goal is at least $50,000 for the treatment
  and to include any co-pays for the part our PPO insurance won’t pay as
  well. Prayers are welcome and appreciated. Thank you for your support. A Day in Ria’s Life Ria takes about 25 pills a day – immunosuppresant, pain, nerve, Gerd,
  esophogical and stomach medicine, anti spasmodic, anti-convulsant,
  anti-anxiety, anti-depressant, anti-biotic and a potassium channel
  blocker. IVIG infusions every 30 days.   Her arm veins are wearing
  thin due to so many infusions both in the hospital and home for 2 years. She eats breakfast, bathes, dresses and grooms with the help of her
  sister whom is her caretaker in the day, so Ria’s mom, Cindy can work
  her day job to keep the bills paid and her medical insurance coverage
  for her girls. In the evenings Ria is cared by her mother. Neither her
  sister or mother have any respite care or back up assistance. We even
  work when we are sick. Without her family’s care Ria would be
  institutionalized. Her family refuses to allow that to happen. Ria spends her time ordering durable medical supplies from vendors,
  fixing any problems with orders, making sure her insurance is covering
  medications, calling in her prescribed medication refills, speaking to
  her doctors about any new issues that may come about her illness,
  going to her doctor’s appointments, seeing her speech pathologist and
  attending physical therapy. She experiences UTI infections frequently
  due to her neurogenic bladder. Doctors usually have to try oral
  antibiotics first but the infections have grown in strenghth and
  frequency that she has to now have i.v. antibiotics to avoid the
  infection reaching her kidneys like it did in Sept 2013. She was
  admitted with Septicemia (blood poisoning from infection) to UCLA
  Ronald Reagan hospital with a temperature of 103 that wouldn’t come
  down despite doctors giving her all the right i.v. medications. We
  prayed as a family for God to help us and he heard our prayers 2 days
  later her fever broke. The infection was under control but she stayed
  another 3 days until infectous disease specialists were sure she had
  no more toxins in her blood. What a scare! She spends time with her family and does as much as she can for
  herself including caring for her Yorkie Bella.",https://fundrazr.com/3pxVe

"1,837",We Need Your Help!,U.S. Dollar,,of $4k goal,45,"I'm Steph. The beautiful boy in the photo is my son, Ethan. He suffers from severe Cavus Foot, which means his arch is so high
  that he literally walks on the very tips of his toes. In addition he
  has scoliosis, which means his spine curves to the side. He cannot ride a bike. He can barely balance when he wears his book
  bag. Stairs are a death sentence. His lower back is in constant pain.
  I have kept him home from school at least 10 days due to
  severe cramps in his legs and feet. He is also an aspy (has asperger's). Though I think this makes him
  THE MOST amazing person I have EVER know, others, unfortunately, will
  not even give him a chance to show them. He has been constantly
  bullied since the 2nd grade and has always hurt him so much because he
  really does love people and gets so upset with himself because he
  doesn't know how to talk to people without them thinking he is ""a
  weirdo"". This breaks my heart in half. So imagine the way he is
  treated by his peers when you combine his social
  ""awkwardness"" with his feet problems. I can assure you that
  the worst things you think kids say and do are ten times less awful
  then what kids really say and do to him. To give you an understanding of how much my son feels for others,
  I'll give you this one quick example of countless instances like it... I was called to pick him up from school one day because he was sick.
  When I got there, I went to the nurse's office and he just started
  crying. I asked ""what hurts?! Do we need to go to the
  hospital!?"" He replied, ""No mom, I just feel really bad that
  you had to leave work and pay for a cab ride all the way here to pick
  me up."" He is unbelievably compassionate and empathetic and for those who
  know others on the spectrum, you know they tend to have
  hypersensitivity to some or all senses. Ethan is hypersensitive to sound and emotion. He wants to make
  everyone happy and it hurts him so much when he thinks he causes any
  kind of stress, pain or disappointment, even when he is sick or hurt. So, yes, he is so sad. And I would never do anything about his way of
  thinking, even if I could, because he is so awesome, but, with your
  help, I can help him with his only other wish. He wants to be able to walk into his first day of high school, like
  the rest of the kids. He wants to run and ride his bike and walk home
  from school without someone calling him twinkle toes or pterodactyl. After months of doctor visits to his neurologist, neurosurgeon,
  orthopedic surgeon, EMT test, 2 MRIs and x-rays, We will finally see
  his orthopedic surgeon next week to set a date for his surgery. The surgery will consist of the cutting and extension of multiple
  tendons in his arch and achelles, the largest being a heel extension
  over 2' long. He will also have tendons removed from some parts of his
  feet and legs, then placed into other areas of tension. He will have
  incisions around calves and just below the knee, as well as larger
  incisions above the knees around his quads and hamstrings. If his full MRI results show that his spinal cord is not tethered, he
  will not have to have surgery on his back, but will have to wear a
  back brace until he is 16 years old for at least 20 hours per day. I cannot work, as he will have all surgery at once and will be nearly
  immobile for 8-10 weeks (at the very least). Once his casts come off,
  he will need extensive and extremely frequent physical therapy for a
  long time. Full recover will be at least one year. His insurance will hopefully cover most of the surgery, but will not
  cover anything else. Bills, food, simple things like soap and toilet paper. Anything you can donate is more appreciated than you can imagine, as
  I am his mother and I want what is best for him. Unfortunately I
  cannot do this alone. With that, I am swallowing my pride and asking for your help. Thank you so much for your love and support. Love, Steph",https://fundrazr.com/give4ethan

385,Orchiectomy Consultation Fund,U.S. Dollar,,of $350 goal,16,"Introduction Hello, and thank you for visiting my crowdfunding campaign page! My
  name is Esther Roth-Colson, and I'm a 31-year-old transgender woman
  originally from upstate New York but now living in St. Louis; I'm the
  producer for The RESIST Podcast , hosted by Danielle Muscato ; and I'm an autism acceptance,
  health insurance access and trans rights activist. Almost exactly a year ago, and after a lifetime of struggling with my
  identity, I came out as a trans woman at 30. I started presenting
  full-time in April 2016 and began hormonal treatment that May. It's
  been a long road since then, but I can honestly say that it's been one
  of the best decisions I've ever made in my life, and now I'm ready to
  start on the next part of this journey: an orchiectomy (removal of my
  testicles) as part of the surgical treatment for my gender/genital dysphoria. My health insurance will pay for the surgery itself, but current
  medical standards require two psychologist evaluations before the
  surgery can be scheduled and performed, and those appointments are not
  covered. After suffering a concussion in February 2017 and being
  hospitalized with complications, I have been unable to perform my
  previous work, and have been living on infrequently-paid disability
  payments since then. I was able to pay for the first psychologist evaluation, but the
  second one will likely cost around $300, and because of my current
  limited income this is a significant expense that is the last thing
  needed before the surgery can be scheduled. WIth the generosity of
  others, I hope to be able to complete this process and move forward on
  something that is extremely important to my mental health and well-being. Thank you very much for any support you may be able to offer! Background Like many trans women, I experience a significant level of gender
  dysphoria, including genital dysphoria. My eventual goal is to have
  full gender-confirming surgery (GCS), but due to some temporary health
  problems, that is still likely a couple of years away. However, one surgery that is available to me right now is an elective
  orchiectomy, which essentially means the removal of my testicles,
  which are a significant source of my genital dysphoria. My insurance will pay for the surgery itself, but there is still one
  significant cost associated with it. Before I can schedule the
  orchiectomy, the current standards for trans healthcare require that I
  receive approval from two independent psychologists to ensure that I
  am making a consensual and informed decision. This process is not covered by my insurance, and so requires
  out-of-pocket payments for each of the psychologists. I was able to
  pay for the first psychologist appointment, and she agreed to provide
  the approval. However, the second psychologist appointment will likely
  cost approximately $300, and as someone receiving disability (and
  infrequently at that, due to the disability insurance company's
  frequent delays), this is a large expense to come up with. A Bit About Myself I'm now 31 years old and live in St. Louis, where I moved in November
  2016. Until February 2017, I worked as an analyst for the federal ACA
  Health Insurance Marketplace (AKA HealthCare.gov), a job that I had
  since November 2013. Unfortunately, a concussion that I suffered
  earlier this year in a household accident has left me with
  post-concussion syndrome that causes dizziness and speech problems,
  preventing me from doing my previous job at this time. Since January, I've also been the producer for The RESIST Podcast, a
  weekly podcast hosted by my friend and fellow trans woman, Danielle
  Muscato, which was launched officially in March. The podcast focuses
  on practical steps that can be taken to resist the effects of a Donald
  Trump administration, fascism and white supremacy. Outside of those areas, I also have a long history of activism on
  various topics, such as health insurance access, autism acceptance,
  LGBTQIA+ rights, and in particular, trans right. If you'd like to connect with me on social media, you can find me on Facebook , and on Twitter, @erothco . Updates Once I am able to schedule the assessment and, then, the surgery, I
  will be posting updates so that all donors can see the progress being made!",https://fundrazr.com/31EGN6
100,Ketamine Infusion Therapy,U.S. Dollar,,of $9k goal,1,"As many of you know I suffer from clinical depression. I have
    tried many treatments — from SSRI medications to electro-shock which
    all have terrible side-effects.  None of my past treatments have
    provided me relief. After doing research, I found that there is extensive research
    and treatment being done now with the drug ketamine.  For many
    sufferers, like me, it is the only effective treatment for recurrent
    major depression.  There are many articles outlining its positive
    effects (e.g. http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/20/520169959/ketamine-for-severe-depression-how-do-you-not-offer-this-drug-to-people ) ""How effective can ketamine be? It has been shown to relieve the
  kind of depression that no other drugs can affect. It's lifted even
  suicidal depression in just hours. With studies into ketamine going on
  for over a decade, a recent statement from the American Psychiatric
  Association says there is “compelling evidence” that it works…"" After a recent crisis I have decided to try Ketamine Infusion
  Therapy. I had a very good experience with my first treatment, and I
  am feeling hopeful that this therapy will finally turn things around
  for me. Currently Ketamine is not covered by insurance as a treatment
  for depression. This means that nothing will be covered by insurance
  and all expenses are entirely out-of-pocket. I am traveling from San Jose to Modesto, CA where the treatment is

"12,798",Stop the pipelines; heal the land; heal the people,Canadian Dollar,,of $30k goal,119,"Stand in solidarity with the Unist'ot'en
  Clan and their commitment to stopping all fossil fuel
  pipelines and to healing and decolonization. Their Territory is
  located about half way between Prince George and Prince Rupert in
  northern British Columbia. Numerous bitumen and fracked gas pipelines
  are proposed to cross this land. The Northern Gateway bitumen pipeline
  may or may not be stopped. But industry and government are also
  pushing ahead with several fracked gas pipelines. (The life cycle
  carbon footprint of fracked gas is similar to that of tar sands bitumen.) Many people first get involved with the Unist'ot'en
    Camp because their stance is clear - there will be no
    pipelines built on this land. But they soon realize that the Camp is
    much more than this. It is a place of learning, of healing, of
    connecting with nature, of breaking with the legacy of colonization. For seven years now the Unist'ot'en Camp has
    stood as a bastion against fossil fuel pipelines - no pipeline work
    has been allowed on their Territory.  The Camp also continues to develop as a healing community with an all season bunk house , a permaculture garden and an under construction Healing Lodge. The Unist'ot'en Healing Lodge ​will have indigenous youth as its main focus. With the generous support of people like you, the kitchen and
    dining hall are already complete and being used every day. This
    Spring, Phase Two, containing counselling and meeting rooms, has
    been partially constructed. Now we need to raise the funds to
    complete this part of the Lodge including the heating system and the
    expansion of the solar electric system. Can you dig deep? This is the frontline - this is where Indigenous
  people and allies are standing together right now - and you can
  be part of this. If you oppose the climate destroying fossil fuel industry - then
  stand with the Unist'ot'en. Donate now! If you are committed to Indigenous land and sovereignty rights - then
  stand with the Unist'ot'en. Donate now! If you appreciate the connection between healing the land and healing
  the people - then stand with the Unist'ot'en. Donate now! As long as the Unist'ot'en Camp stands, no pipelines

120,Baby Blessings- We wont give up,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,2,"Our story begins with love. I pray that it would touch your heart. On
  July 16, 2004 I met Aidin, my best friend. The first day we met, was
  the first day that I recognized love. We married 4 years later at Lake
  Mead, NV, during a sunset and standing over a cliff. It was a memory
  that will never leave my mind. From that day forward we knew we wanted
  to be a family but life threw us obstacles. I was diagnosed with 2 grapefruit sized tumors on my ovaries which
  had to be removed ASAP. While in recovery, my husband and I were told
  news that killed all hope for a baby. Due to the size, shape and
  placement of my tumors, the surgeon deemed it medically necessary to
  remove my right ovary and my tubes. We had no hope of a successful
  tubal reversal as the tube on my left was full of scar tissue and had
  no hope of repair. We were absolutely devastated. It wasn’t until 6
  months ago that we have given IVF a thought. After discussing this
  with my OB/GYN, she stated that since I still had my left ovary, I
  would be a good candidate for IVF. Hope renews itself! So with the
  summary of our story, we have had numerous obstacles to overcome, and
  financially speaking, this is another one. We thank all hearts for
  those who have read our story, and donated to our future baby. Any
  amounts $1-$10,000 is a blessing to us. We thank you from the bottom
  of our hearts and realize our future baby won’t be possible without
  your love and support.",https://fundrazr.com/61BkNe
150,Help Abi to continue walking.,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,2,"Hi, I’m Claudia, Abi's mother, Abi suffers from a weird disease
    here in México called Axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy Charcot
    Marie Tooth ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charcot%E2%80%93Marie%E2%80%93Tooth_disease ). It's more common in Europe And The United States Abi was born like a normal person. She used to climb a lot, to
    run, to jump, to swim ... until one day at the age of 5 years old I
    saw that she started limping and walking in 1000 different ways
    until she ended up walking like a duck - with both feet sticking out. Then I started to visit a bunch of the best doctors in the
    country to find an answer until they told me it was a weird
    hereditary progressive disease with no cure. They told me that her
    life since that day would be limited. She would need to be cared for
    24/7 as well as daily therapies that would help her to continue
    walking. Since that day I have been taking care of Abi 24/7. Over time her disease has evolved, making almost all of her
    muscles from half thigh to the toes disappear. There is no muscles
    from the knees to the toes it's like the bottom part of her knees
    doesn't exist. By the evolution of the disease, the doctor told me that she
    needs a new orthosis because of her height (1.75m) and weight (69kg)
    she has. The orthosis that she have right now does not do the function it
    used to do. The new orthosis we want to buy will give her more support and
    stability for her actual weight and height. Right now she is in bed
    because she fell last Monday and she broke her ankle. The reason why was because her orthosis that she has currently
    does not work properly. Unfortunately a fall for her it is extremely
    dangerous. However for normal human beings a fall is nothing. If we
    break one of our bones we just rest and will get well soon. For Abi
    it is different. She would have to rest for 2/3 months while missing
    out school and possibly losing the capacity she has to walk. I have no one to support me. This illness is not only hard work
    but is also time consuming. The father quit four years ago and so
    have all our family members. The government here do not support you
    with anything. It is just Abi, my son and me. Because Abi requires
    24/7 care I am not able to get a job. I can’t just leave her in the
    house home alone. I have had to sell my car to survive some months
    which has affected the care and the therapies that she needs. That
    is why I beg you to help to buy her a new orthosis so she can
    continue walking, to see the possibility to have a used car so I can
    take her to the therapies and school, so she can continue walking
    some steps, so she can start so she can start high school, continue
    studying and continue having excellent grades and adjustments in the
    house (a special bathroom and a ramp). She has an intact
    intellectual capacity that the disease can not touch and according
    to medical diagnosis, it will not touch. This is why I fight, so
    that she can have a normal life and not be locked up at home because
    she can’t walk. Please pray for Abi. Share this with all your friends and
    familiars so that we can get the goal and let Abi have a better
    life. We just want her to be able to walk like any other person.
    Don’t let this limit her life. We can do this!",https://fundrazr.com/61Fyq3
265,Ben - Young designer with deuteranomaly needs you,Euro,,of €250 goal,14,"Today I was confronted with my problem again, which is deuteranomaly
  (a type of red-green blindness), so I began to research again and
  found enchroma which I already know of for a long time already but
  never thought of getting it because of the high price. I remember the
  first time I saw videos of people using enchroma glasses and their
  reaction is just phenomenal. ""Deutans are people with deuteranomaly, a type of red-green
  color blindness in which the green cone s do not detect enough
    green and are too sensitive to yellows, oranges, and reds."" In design, color theory is a big part of the process that I will
    never master, I thought - since I have deuteranomaly. But still I
    try my best to do my design and choose the colors that I am
    confident with. Since I still see ""most"" colors except for
    the ones between red and green, I still can differentiate most of
    the colors but I am very limited to the choice of the tone. I never
    can be sure that it is a good combination, so I usually look up
    color schemes by other designers instead of creating my own set of
    colors which is disappointing to me. But it's my only resort if I
    want to have a good work unless I ask my friends/family (usually my
    sister haha). So anyone who want to help me, can feel free to donate something. I
    set the goal to $250. A pair of enchroma glasses can cost up to
    $430, but I will pay for the rest by myself. I didn't want to just
    let other people pay all for me, but still would appreciate your help. I don't expect much, just thought I would give it a try. Thank you.

200,~*~Enchroma Glasses for my Boyfriend~*~,U.S. Dollar,,of $375 goal,3,"HI THERE! My boyfriend and I are a couple of
      grad students, who met almost a year ago on a dating app. Life has
      never been the same since, and that's just the way we like it! He has moderate-profound deuteranopia, meaning the cones in his
    eyes that perceive green light don't work as well as they should.
    This prevents him from seeing certain things, such as red flowers
    blooming in green trees, or that he bought a pink shirt and green
    pants instead of a white shirt and brown pants. What started as pondering what to get him for our first anniversary
    turned into the idea of doing a modified Five Senses gift. For those
    who haven't heard of this, usually you give the person five small
    gifts that appeal to each of the five senses, such as scented
    candles for Smell, or a new CD for Hearing. However, I thought it
    would be cool if instead, I could give him larger gifts, and allow
    him to choose which sense he wanted on five special occasions
    throughout the year. Enter Enchroma, the colorblindness-correcting glasses. I cannot
    think of a more perfect gift for the sense of Sight. He has brought
    so much joy and beauty into my life and those around us. Please help
    me return the favor by donating. Any amount helps. I would like to purchase the Receptor glasses, as
    they are reasonably-priced and will fit over his existing glasses.
    All proceeds under the goal of $375 will go to Fundrazr/WePay/PayPal
    fees, and the purchase of the glasses. Any proceeds over $375 will
    go to upgrading the Enchroma glasses with prescription lenses
    (~$150.) If donations somehow exceed $525, the remaining proceeds
    will go to help with the cost of the other Five Senses gifts

  Sclerosis. This is the most severe of all forms of MS with a rapid
  downhill progression.  There is no treatment for this type of MS. Curtiss is not only a fighter of MS he is also known as a Husband,
  father and grandpa. He was diagnosed with MS April 2010 at the age of 37. At the
  time he was working at Honeywell, where he had been for 15 of his 17
  year career in U.A.469 Refrigeration. Within 3 months after his
  diagnosis, he had to retire on disability. He now misses out on
  everyday life events, such as being a grandpa. His grandson, Julian,
  is now 6 and Curtiss has not been able to attend karate practice, swim
  class or even grandparents day at school. His first symptoms were loss of dexterity in his hands and loss
  of coordination in his legs. From that point on he continued to
  digress with repeated hospital visits due to falling numerous times
  which caused multiple head injuries, nasal fractures and 3 long days
  spent in the ICU. By February 2011, Curtiss was in a wheel chair. By June of
  2013, he was no longer able to drive. He was fully dependent on his
  wife who had to quit her job and become his full time caregiver. He is
  unable to shower, get in and out of bed and perform normal day to
  day tasks without her help. He has had to remodel his bathroom and various parts of his
  home to make it handicap accessible at great expense to him.  Curtiss
  has had to upgrade his current wheelchair based on his every day
  needs. Since he is no longer able to stand on his own, he needs a
  wheelchair that will stand him up so that he can get in and out of bed
  and transfer to his shower seat. Most of the cost of the expensive new wheelchair will be paid
  by his insurance company but he needs money for his copay which may be
  as high as $10,000. He has difficulty to get into his vehicle. A van with a ramp
  for transport will make it easier to accommodate his needs In order to
  get a used van he needs around $55,000.  A newer van should allow him
  years of vehicle usage with minimum out of pocket repairs and
  expenses.  He is confined to his house now due to lack of transport.
  Curtiss now misses out on his weekly guys night at the local
  restaurant down the street. He can’t spend the quality time with his
  wife on date nights due to the struggle of not being able to move in
  and out of the vehicle. He is stuck in the house waiting for his
  grandson to run in excited to tell his grandpa about earning his next
  belt in karate or moving into the next level in swim class. His
  grandson tells him daily “when you get your chair grandpa we will go
  to the park”. This is where you come in. Please help
  Curtiss get his freedom back and donate to help fund mounting expenses

"2,750",Health Care + Social Justice,U.S. Dollar,,of $17.4k goal,12,"MY STORY Who Am I? That's a big question.  I will try to keep it simple.  I am a woman
  on a mission.  My mission: to attend graduate school at POCA Tech in
  Portland, OR. Why? I feel passionate about the mission of POCA Tech. ""...to provide acupuncture to underserved communities
    through the People’s Organization of Community Acupuncture (POCA)..."" ""...to train the next generation of community
    acupuncturists. Community Acupuncture is a social business model
    providing affordable & accessible acupuncture to whoever needs
    and wants it. Community acupuncture is about health care, but it is
    also about social justice & affordable access to health care."" I could not say it better than as expressed on the POCA Tech website
  as to what affordable care means to patients of community acupuncture: ""...the biggest impact of having low funds is that in
    every direction, it limits your options. Community Acupuncture is a
    treasure. It is a mighty weapon in my quest to maintain (and now
    IMPROVE) my health...Community Acupuncture will also PREVENT many
    future health complications."" ""...Life is often difficult. Sometimes bad things happen
    and your resources are limited. Community Acupuncture means that
    there is still hope, that life can improve, that one's days can at
    the least be more bearable."" ""...""affordable acupuncture can heal the
    world."" Freedom from pain and increased abilities allow me to
    be a better steward of my resources and to make a more positive
    impact on my world...Affordable acupuncture does not enable me, it
    empowers me. By gifting me with better health I can then go out and
    do my part to fix the ills around me. The outward ripples of healing
    from Community Acupuncture are exponential."" ""...Somewhere there is the idea that people with limited
    funds have used bad judgement to get to such a position...this
    viewpoint overlooks the reality that situations and people
    can...change. Life itself is valuable and should be cherished. The
    world would be very miserable indeed if there were no second
    chances. Every time I visit my Community Acupuncture clinic, I see
    and hear the punks being heroes to people in need. In my opinion
    this is true beauty."" What will the funds raised be used for? Because POCA Tech has a different model, traditional student loans
  are not available.  I am so sure in my heart that this is the way
  forward - for me, for acupuncture, for affordable health care, for
  social justice.  I will use the funds raised to pay my tuition.  I
  will work through school as hard and as much as I can to support the
  day to day of my life.  What I need most help with is tuition.  The
  total tuition for POCA Tech is $17,400.  I know, I am shooting for the
  moon.  I am trusting, I am believing, I am hoping for a miracle. From the POCA TECH Website: "" This is the Equation: the cost of becoming an acupuncturist (education, certification,
      licensing, and setting up a practice) should roughly = what an
      acupuncturist can expect to earn in their first 12-18 months of practice Everything about POCA Tech’s program is designed to make the
    Equation work. "" The cost of acupuncture programs ranges from $40k - $100K.  POCA Tech
  is completely intentional in their creation of an affordable
  acupuncture education to ensure the ability to graduate and to offer,
  through a model of social justice, affordable health care to all.
   Acupuncture for the people! I need help. I want to be a part of this revolution.  POCA Tech is shattering the

550,Freeze Baby LaPlume's Stem Cells,Euro,,of €1.7k goal,2,"This time we would like to do something different. As most of you
  know and used it, we had a Baby Registry for Lina and we received
  wonderful items for her. We held on to everything and valued it,
  thinking we might get to use it again later. Well so it happens, we
  are setting up the nursery and even the overseas move was good to it
  all. So we would prefer to use the same items again. After doing some
  research we also found out that some things, including clothes are not
  being shipped to APO/military addresses for whatever reason which
  would also make it hard with a Baby Registry. So we decided to go a
  different route. Instead of a Baby Registry we would like you to be
  part of our Baby's Stem Cell Freezing. Whatever amount you would have
  spent on something on a registry just donate it here, preferably with
  a name so we can create a card and put down all names so he/she will
  know later who was part of it. Of course we are hoping that it will
  never come to the point that she/he is in need of the Stem Cells but
  it sure is a nice thought that if there is the need for it you all
  were part of saving her/his life. This plan covers freezing for 25
  years and after that he/she can decide to extend it or not. We have
  Lina's Stem Cells frozen and we are going to do so for this one but we

"1,897",Please help us with the hospital bill of my Dad.,U.S. Dollar,,of $17k goal,47,"Hi everyone, My name is Paul De La Torre. I am from Philippines. I am 30 years
  old. I am the 4th child among 6 siblings. I am a Christian. My cause is to raise funds for my Dad's heart operation. My Dad
  is 67 years old, he is also a Christian in fact all in the family are
  Christian. When we were still little, my Dad reads to us a chapter or
  two of the bible every week. He molded us to become good citizens to
  fear God and be good to everyone around us. We are not wealthy, we get
  by our lives just enough for us to keep on living. Despite of that, we
  manage to pull through. Our salaries and wages from our jobs is just
  enough for us to keep ourselves fed and have a roof under our heads. My Dad is no longer working. My Dad is suffering from a heart
  ailment. His heart is enlarged and on August 2, 2017 - a day we did
  not expect to happen. I was sleeping in my room when my sister woke me
  up and told me that my Dad was feeling unwell and he is felt pain in
  his chest. I was worried on what my Dad was feeling. I asked him if he
  wanted to go to the hospital. He said, he only wants a check up since
  we know we do not have a big fund for us to be admitted to the
  hospital. But then as we went to the hospital, we decided to go
  directly to the emergency room because my other siblings suggested
  that it is better, just to make sure it doesn't get any worse. Upon arriving at the hospital, my dad was checked and went for an
  X-Ray, blood test, and ECG. It was later found out that the pain my
  Dad felt was a heart attack. Seeing your Dad, suffer, and the thought of possibly losing him is
  hard. My siblings and my mom, wants to save my Dad's life. We tried
  our best to ask, and borrow money from the people close to us, and the
  people we know who can lend us financial help. But as the days passed
  by, our medical bills keep piling up, and the doctors suggested to
  have him undergo Angioplasty operation since it was seen that 3
  arteries are blocked already. One artery was blocked 100% the other
  two was blocked 70%. My Dad is having difficulty breathing and the
  doctor said if this won't be addressed soon. It could be fatal. We
  managed to borrow some money for one artery (the 100% blocked) to
  undergo Angioplasty, but the money we borrowed is not enough for the
  other 2 blocked arteries to be operated upon. Me and my family are asking from your kind hearts to lend us a
  helping hand, as we try to give my Dad a second chance at life. He is
  a very good father. He is responsible. He has wonderful insights about
  life and living. He is a loving father. He takes good care of all of
  us. He is loved by many. I only wish he can survive this medical
  challenge he is facing now, indeed the doctors assured that he can
  survive after the operation is done. Please help us fund his
  operation. He needs to have 3 stents of angioplasty operation. We will
  be very grateful for whatever amount you can give us. It will surely
  help my Dad. My mom and silbings are struggling to raise funds
    to pay the ballooning hospital bills and for the future stage 2
    procedures. Our Lord will surely repay you as what Proverbs
  19:17 says "" Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord , and he will repay him for his deed."" No donation is too small and it will mean so much to my family. Thank you very much for your help and time. Please leave me a
  message whether it is for me or for my Dad. From the bottom of my
  heart and my family. Thank you very much for your help. We are
  eternally grateful for the financial assistance. God Bless you always.",https://fundrazr.com/41GeR3

"5,720",Ancestral Microbiome: Chasing Health,,,,,"Since the summer of 2013, my colleagues and I have been working and
  living among the Hadza hunter foragers of Tanzania. As the last hunter
  forager group in Tanzania - who literally still hunt the same animals
  and gather the same plants that our ancestors did for millions of
  years - the Hadza may hold in their guts some
    important clues to what a healthy or optimal gut microbiome might
    look like at different stages of life. By collecting stool samples from hundreds of Hadza as they shift
  between seasonal resources - and freezing them in liquid nitrogen in
  the field - we use next generation sequencing to map composition of
  microbes in the Hadza gut. With this information - along with detailed
  diet and lifestyle data - we can compare this ancestral microbiome to
  thousands of westerners in the American Gut Project - the
  largest open source and crowd funded science project in the world (a
  project I co-founded). Even though we've raised money for the Hadza project - and received
  mountains of free sequencing via our colleagues at the Earth Microbiome Project - we need more funds to
  continue our field work. What we've accomplished and learned so far and what else needs
    to be done: Accomplished and Learned Collected and sequenced ~1,500 fecal, skin, water, soil, animal
    and plant samples from ""Hadza Land"" over the course of two
    field sessions (2013-2015). This represents the largest number of
    samples ever sequenced for a rural or ancestral population anywhere
    in the world. Acquired and outfitted a 4x4 Land Cruiser for rough and rugged
    landscape of East Africa (and cobbled together tents, tables,
    chairs, satellite dish for internet, and so on for our base camp). Trained two Tanzanian field assistants - ongoing process. Put together a world-class team of researchers - who are mentioned
    in this 3-page feature about our project that appeared in the
    prestigious journal Science - from New
    York University, Stanford, UCSD, and researchers from the National
    Institute of Medical Research in Tanzania to collaborate on the analysis. Applied for and acquired all necassary permits and ethical
    clearances (IRB) for the study in Tanzania and the U.S. Not any easy
    task given the layers and layers of bureaucracy! Though we haven't published any of our data yet (coming 2016), we
    are excited that we have documented a seasonal shift in the Hadza
    gut microbiome between dry and wet season. This is critical as it
    goes to the heart of what an optimal or balanced gut microbiome
    might look - in other words, it may be a moving target if evolution
    is our guide. We also see differences between men and women,
    something we don't see in western societies. We also see much
    greater diversity of microbes on and in the Hadza when compared to
    us westerners. Mounting research suggests this diversity may be our
    ancestral state and protective! We also don't see a drop in the
    diversity as Hadza age - something that happens in western
    populations. We also see an extraordinary diversity of microbes in
    the Hadza environment as a result of our environmental sampling of
    plants, animals, soil, water and so on. This ""meta
    community"" of microbes is the source pool for Hadza microbes.
    We also see interesting patterns in the breastfed babies not seen in
    the western babies. And the list goes on! What Needs To Be Done - WE NEED YOUR HELP Based on our initial sampling and data, we will be submitting our
    results for peer-review publication in 2016. This is where
      you come in! We need funds for diesel, fuel, beans and rice,
      supplies, salaries for Tanzanian research assistants, and
      never-ending repairs to our aging field vehicle. Every nickel counts! Now that we have sampled a large number of Hadza across multiple
    seasons and bush camps, we are now focusing on following a much
    smaller group of Hadza for detailed longitidunal sampling (we are
    also very, very interested in detailed sampling of newborns,
    essentially sampling them from birth through introduction of first
    solids at 4-6 months). In addition, we want to expand our data set
    of environmental samples from plants and animals in Hadza land as
    this is critical to understanding where and how a
    ""free-living"" human population acquires microbes from the environment. If you would like to consider an ""off line"" donation

130,Help me see a rainbow for my birthday.,Pound Sterling,,of £350 goal,10,"About Me My name's Adam and I live in Cardiff, the capital city of Wales, in
  the United Kingdom. I'm 15 years old and it's my birthday today. I've
  been looking at these glasses for some time now, but have never had
  the money to afford a pair. I go to school and am undergoing my GCSE exams. My Experiences I'd almost completely forgotten about these glasses until I was
  sitting one of my Science exams - Biology I think. I had memorised all
  the colour changes of the reactions before the exam so that I would be
  equipped for the exam in all its capacity. Unfortunately, I turned one
  of the pages and the next question relied solely on seeing the colour
  of the reactions on the page - something that I was unable to do.
  Don't worry - I managed to answer the question fine because of what I
  had remembered in preparation. But it was harder for me than it had to
  be - all because of my unfortunate affliction. This is only the most recent event where not seeing colours has
  affected me - but I can assure you there are hundreds, if not
  thousands of other examples like this in my day to day life (if not
  less extreme). Colour blindness And My Life For all of my life, I have experienced unfortunate circumstances with
  colours, like the one mentioned above. Ever since I was a little boy
  (about four years old), I've known about this thing that I was taught
  I had to live with. At about the age of 13, I saw a video that my friend showed me of
  someone's reaction to having these glasses and to see the colour
  purple for the very first time. Ever since that day, I've been fixated
  by these magical glasses, with some very complex and, let's not lie,
  not entirely understandable engineering. But only one thing matters -
  they work. My Family And Colour blindness My Grandad had to go his whole life without seeing colours. My Mum,
  being a woman, didn't have to experience this, and neither has my
  brother; but I, drawing the short straw, have to deal with colour
  blindness in my everyday life and in situations where life would be a
  whole lot easier if I could just see that thing that I need to see. Why I Need Your Help Being a student (and a young one at that), my income is currently
  nil. Though I currently volunteer, helping with children, I earn no
  money through doing so. I have, however, managed to save up some money
  from doing chores and from birthdays and Christmases, but nowhere near
  enough to buy EnChroma glasses - especially with the added shipping
  and handling fees of getting delivered to the UK. My family can't really help either. I wouldn't call us poor - not by
  any means. But we earn what we need, and we don't have that excess
  amount of money needed to spend on glasses that I can, unfortunately,
  do without. What You Can Do I need your help to do this - without it, I could go my whole life
  without seeing colours properly. If you can donate anything - from $1
  to $100 - I'm grateful to everybody who decides to donate to me and
  decides to help me see the world how it should be seen. If you don't have the money to donate or if you've already donated,
  you can still help! Share my campaign with your friends, family, loved
  ones, or just any old person you bump in to and I will be so grateful.
  If any of them can donate, then you will have done me a favour by
  referring them. Your Donations If any of you are kind enough to donate to me, your money will go
  towards the glasses - a means for me to see the world as it should be
  seen, as it's meant to be seen. I need $349 for the Gilman glasses,
  and possibly a bit more to handle the shipping (depending on how much
  it comes to). Finishing Thoughts I don't really know what to say, or how to finish this. So I'll just
  say thank you. Thank you to everyone who donates, thank you to
  everyone who tells their friends, and thank you - thank you for caring.",https://fundrazr.com/f1Ge18

105,Justin's Journey,U.S. Dollar,"Nov 30, 2017",of $5k goal,3,"Hi There! We’re a family of four that are in great need of support to help
    our youngest member Justin, recover from Lyme’s Disease, as well as
    rehab off of addictive Schizophrenic medication. In short, he was bitten by a deer tick on an eco-estate, which
    had imported deer from Germany, and he came down with all the
    symptoms of Lyme’s Disease. In South Africa where we stay, there are
    no facilities to test for Lyme’s Disease and doctors automatically
    rule that out as a diagnosis, because it’s widely believed that one
    can’t contract it here. Instead, they misdiagnosed Justin with
    Schizophrenia and placed him on a treatment that seems to have
    caused even more neurological damage in the years to follow. One of the main problems that Justin has is severe insomnia,
    which seems to have gotten way worse since he’s been on the
    anti-psychotic medication. Some of the latest research on insomnia
    suggests that the brain begins to “eat itself” after extended
    periods of sleep deprivation, which we can relate to – sometimes
    Justin is no different to someone with Alzheimer’s Disease or
    Dementia. When Justin sleeps however, the majority of his symptoms
    rapidly improves and we strongly believe with your help that we can
    find a way to reverse his condition! The Plan While spending many hours looking for ways to solve this
    problem, mom found a perfect neurologist in the US who seems to be
    an expert in dealing with cases like Justin’s. Dr Klinghardt
      is an expert in neurology and devising holistic treatment
    protocols to help his patients heal. We believe that this doctor
    will be able to accurately diagnose and treat Justin. In addition,
    we also have found various medical centers that test genetics
    (unlike in South Africa) so that we may get an exact understanding
    of Justin’s condition. We need funds to fly to the US to receive proper diagnosis and
  treatment . We need a total of $50K to cover our basic costs
  (it may cost more depending on what the doctor says). We will need to
  stay overseas for up to six months and this funding will cover
  airfares, modest accommodation, diagnostic tests and Justin’s
  treatment for six months. We believe that Dr Klinghardt, in combination with genetic profiling
  will get to the root of the problem. You can find out more info about
  him here: http://drklinghardt.com/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKx_TMPQJsY The Full Story Every day that passes we watch Justin slip further away both
    physically and mentally … Some days are better than others … He
    suffers so much in his confused exhaustion that it’s hard to witness
    and difficult to live with. We honestly don’t know how he manages to
    continue, and so bravely, when his nightmare never seems to end. Justin’s problems began after he was misdiagnosed with
      Schizophrenia almost 4 years ago following a tick bite. The eco-estate we lived on at that time, had a private game
    reserve that included imported deer from Europe, amongst a variety
    of other game. Justin contracted his bite whilst being taken for a
    walk by our two huskies in the game park. He lost his balance and
    was dragged along for a short way. Two days later, mom spotted a
    tick on his leg and removed it. She noticed that it was unlike any
    of the species we normally see in South Africa. After searching for
    ticks on google images, we saw that it was identical to ticks that
    are found on deer in Europe and in the US; and that they are the
    ones that give people a disease called Lyme’s disease. In
      South Africa, there is no test for Lyme’s Disease, since
    it is widely believed that we don’t have ticks that transmit this
    disease in our country. In the year before, our dad died suddenly when he was
      hit by a car as he was crossing a street. We had no
    choice but to use the local government hospital to treat Justin’s
    condition, as we couldn’t afford private health care. The hospital
    staff dismissed our fears of Lyme’s disease from the start, and
    because he had been depressed and suffered from insomnia after dad’s
    death, they concluded that Justin had Schizophrenia. Initially, the
    anti-psychotic meds and benzodiazepines showed a modest improvement,
    but Justin became severely sleep deprived and was unable to sleep
    deeply or experience life normally. After a few months, a family friend donated funds so that we
    could treat Justin privately. He was taken off the hospital
    medications and slowly started to recover with a natural holistic
    program. He made steady progress in this
    time. Although he was not the same person as before, he was
    at least able to play the piano again and integrate back into being
    a part of the family. During this time, mom stopped working and his
    older brother moved back home to help us (sister and mom) care for
    him, as well as put food on the table. The medical expenses were
    exorbitant and after a year we could no longer continue with private treatment. By the end of 2015, two years after Justin’s initial tick bite, he was bitten a second time , but this time it was
    by one of our local ticks. It's usually fairly easy to recover from
    an acute bout of tick bite fever from these ticks, but in Justin’s
    case the whole nightmare we thought was behind us began all over
    again … We had to rush him intohospital and this
    time he was put on even stronger anti-psychotic medication. The
    doctors we saw (a different one every time) believed that he had
    relapsed because we had taken him off the previous prescription
    of anti-psychotic meds. In spite of the latest medication, Justin has not recovered
    since and in the last 18 months he has deteriorated rapidly. He has
    lost over 24 kilograms in the last 7 months. He sleeps a few hours
    every 4 -5 nights. He has dream states and rapid eye movements in
    mid sentence and his memory is not functional. He has become very
    childlike and needs constant supervision and input. Since
      being on the benzodiazepine medicine, he has also developed
      obsessive behaviors , like having the same conversations
    over and over, bingeing on food or pacing in continuous loops
    through the house. He is very stressed and unable to relate to
    people or even our animals, although he adored them before and used
    to spend the most time with them. The medications have not worked and we believe that they are
      making his condition worse - he has become a hollow shell of his former beautiful self.
    The hospital’s staff says that there is nothing we can do; except
    put him on even stronger medications and put him into a government
    institution. The place they recommend has a ghastly reputation and
    is like a prison for the insane - it's like giving him a living
    death sentence. Our family feels that this is outrageous – it is not
    a solution and we cannot agree to just give up on Justin, especially
    after we have already seen him nearly recovered the first time!
    Justin needs expert help that is not available in our
    under-resourced public health system. After reviewing all the
    research we could find, we believe that we need to take him
      overseas to the US to get a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",https://fundrazr.com/41GoD5

  oranges or any color in between, I see these colors as muted greys and
  browns. Yellow and blue are my favorite colors because I can see them.
  Recently I was granted admisssion to graduate school in applied
  geography studying geomorphology and the climate. Maps and other
  activities associated with this major make it difficult for me to
  perceive what a maps story is trying to tell me. This semester I am in
  a soils class which I profile layers of soil but my inability to see
  color in the reds has me struggling to accurately see these profiles
  correctly. I am usually not one of those people who ask for much and I
  consider myself more of a giver. This would change my world and life
  experiences for years to come. I appreciate you reading my story and

      multiple times in college. In the past year, I've been
      diagnosed with PTSD. Needless to say, I have my issues. But this isn't about me. This is about Kevin, and why he
      should get a pair of EnChroma glasses. Kevin and his wife, who I met
      through their son (my boyfriend), met me and pretty much instantly
      took me in. In the past two years, long story short, the joke's
      become that I get to keep them in the divorce. They've been my advisors when I've
      had few others to turn to. They've opened their home to me, given
      me a place to feel safe when my brain gets twitchy and starts
      viewing the world around me as a threat, shared holidays and
      birthdays and basically been a slightly more sane version of the
      Callahans to my Sandra Bullock in While You Were Sleeping (without the coma and confusion of brothers). They've given me a home. Kevin is red-green color blind.
      Shortly after I met him he showed me an app that gave me a look
      through his eyes into what he termed his ""sad little
      world"". Kevin is also a massive, massive
      geek. Imagine watching Star Wars and not being able to tell the
      difference between the lightsabers, not having a complete idea of
      what a redshirt looks like, or going to Comic Con and not seeing
      the brilliant colors that follows cosplayers everywhere they go. I'd heard of EnChroma before--just,
      never been in a place to try and afford it, but instantly I wanted
      to try and brighten his world with all the color the majority of
      the population gets to see every day. I figure it's time to stop putting it off. I just still need
      a little help. Please, help me get these glasses
      for him. Help him literally see what he's
      helped me to see. Help me, in some small way, repay him. Kevin wears prescription glasses, so, the $499 is the goal. PS: If you know him, keep it secret! I'm hoping to get this

"1,675",Let's help Malika to get her smile back,U.S. Dollar,,of $4.5k goal,13,"Welcome to our crowdfunding page to help 9 year old Malika.
    She's suffering from a terrible genetic blood disease. We are
    collecting money to pay her family's medical bills and transport to
    a specialized hospital. About us: Prepare yourself for a trip around the world My name is Bart (from The Netherlands) and I've started this
    project after I've learned from my girlfriend Nadira, that her 9 year old niece Malika (from Kyrgyzstan) is very
    sick and in desperate need of a cure. Malika has been diagnosed with
    hereditary Hemolytic Anemias, an autoimmune
    disease . Although Nadira and her family are doing their
    part of local crowdfunding, it is not going as fast as we had hoped
    for. That’s why we've decided to make this an international cause,
    to speed up the process of collecting the necessary
      funds…. before it is too late . About Malike and her condition Malika (born 16/12/2007) is a nice, beautiful,
    intelligent and very talented young girl , native of
  Kyrgyzstan, Central-Asia. Malike is a purposeful character and every
  day she’s struggling for her life. This girl tries to hold on, but her organs are giving up , she does not have the
  strength to even smile now. Malika was diagnosed with a form of hereditary hemolytic anemia . Every day her health
    worsens, internal organs begin to suffer: the spleen and
      liver are enlarged , the jaundice (yellowish color)
  of the skin is increasing. Other symptons she’s enduring are
  headaches, fever, periodic weakness and a decreased appetite. Watch a short video about Malika and her mother (in Russian). Malika loves to play with dolls and to sew doll clothes. Her
    other hobby is to have fun with play doh, as you can see in the
    video. She has one younger brother and lives together with her
    family (Mrs. Tahmina and Mr. Pope
    Ravshan) in Bishkek. Read a background story on this Kyrgyz website for more info
    (in Russian, use your browser's translator). Correct diagnoses and treatment Because there is no relevant equipment in her own country, she cannot be diagnosed accurately in order to
    prescribe further treatment. For this reason, she’ll need to be
    examined and treated in a state-of-the-art clinic in Moscow. Little
    problem: this is 2500 miles away from their home. Because Malike is
    not a citizen of the Russian Federation, this undertaking is
      very expensive . The consultation of a doctor costs
    $3,000. The family doesn’t have the opportunity to pay . The hostipal where Malike needs to go is specialized in
      the treatment of this disease. Dmitry Rogachev National Research Center How much money do we need? Important EU-citizens: Problems with donating
    by Paypal or Creditcard? Contact us and we will provide an IBAN nr. Malika and her family are desparetly in need of money for transportation to Moscow and an initial examination at a
      specialized hospital . Accommodation during this time will
    be provided by relatives in Moscow. The costs for the first
    examination will be $3,000. After this has taken place, a treatment
    will hopefully start soon. For the travel and initial examination
    costs we are targeting to collect $4,500 . For the
    follow-up treatment, we have no idea yet how much this will cost. Now, to put things in perspective: Malika's father
      (Pope) earns $150 per month as a taxi driver. Don't be
    surprised; this is a decent income in Kyrgysztan. However, you'll
    understand this is not enough to pay hospital bills in Moscow or to
    put them on a flight. For Russian speaking people Ниже мои данные для перевода денег: Исакова Надира, номер карты 4276380040163409 Read Russian update Information about hereditary hemolytic anemia There are many types of hemolytic anemia. With inherited hemolytic
  anemias, one or more of the genes that control red blood cell
  production are faulty. This can lead to problems with the hemoglobin,
  cell membrane, or enzymes that maintain healthy red blood cells. Some symptoms of hemolytic anemia are the same as other forms of anemia. These common symptoms include: paleness of the skin fatigue fever confusion lightheadedness dizziness weakness or inability to do physical activity Other less common signs and symptoms that are seen in patients with
  hemolytic anemia include: dark urine yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) heart murmur increased heart rate enlarged spleen enlarged liver Sources: visit this website and this website for more information

    deficiency until 2 years ago and I thought it wasn’t the big deal,
    I’ve been colorblind all my life but It’s been really hard because
    of my job and my passion that is to paint/draw portraits. Since I was a kid I had to rely on color pencils with name printed
    names printed on them so I could tell the difference between each
    color, nowadays Photoshop is my main tool I use everyday at work.
    Sadly, all my life I thought I was seeing the same colors anyone can see. I thought I could see like any normal person, but after knowing
    that I am colorblind, confusion is a feeling that I have everyday. I
    have been struggling all this time trying to tell the difference
    between colors and I was so excited when a friend showed me the

"1,905",Please help us pay for Duane's unexpected expenses,U.S. Dollar,,of $6k goal,21,"Duane R. Jones 55, until recently, had been a hard working man all
  his life in the Corpus Christi, Texas area. Many in his community know
  him from Mars Vacuum, where he worked for 20 plus years. And was also
  known for being very generous with his homegrown vegetables and
  homemade pickles. Duane was hospitalized with Pneumonia. While being treated for that,
  he developed another case of it. He was diagnosed with pulmonary
  fibrosis and major scarring of the lungs during his recent  2 month
  hospital stay and is in need of a lung transplant. Fortunately, Mr. Jones has insurance to help cover some of these
  medical expenses, but as he learns to adjust to his new life hooked up
  to Oxygen, he is unable to re join the workforce anytime in the near future. Besides the usual household expenses and now co-pays, his HVAC unit
  is in dire need of replacement.  Temporary fixes have helped, but he
  really needs a new unit. Being on oxygen and struggling to breathe,
   Should he go in for surgery, worrying about whether he will have air
  conditioning or heat should be the least of his concerns. Funds raised from this campaign will go towards that major expense,
  and help out with other bills and other unforseen expenses. Duane has always been a very kind and giving person and with limited
  funds, is in need of help during this difficult time.  His goal is to

      my Dad has never seen. I am his daughter, Kristy.  I want to give my Dad something
      he has never had in HIS life... C O L O R ! I was raised by a single
        father who loved, gave and installed traits and manners in me
        that I wouldn't trade for anything. He also has two wonderful
        sons, one being an artist.  My father has a keen eye for art but
        has never seen the true colors of my brother artistic
        accomplishments or any of the other pieces of art work he owns. My goal in getting these
        glasses for my Dad is so he can see and be in awe of all of the
        incredible spectrum of color that this world holds. He is in the golf
          business.  Can you imagine never really being able to see the
          true greens of a golf course? Also he needs assistance
          to put outfits together due to his color blindness,,,all my
          life I have been assisting him with what goes with what, along

          color purple was before putting these glasses on? So my goal is for my dad

          giving, compassionate, funny, loving and the best dad anyone
          could ever have!  Please help him to see the colors that we

      have been wanting to get these glasses for Josh the moment I saw
      them in the news. I just kept thinking how can someone go their
      entire life without seeing the leaves change in fall, the color of
      his favorite shirt, a ripe apple, or fully cooked meat. When we
      were planning our wedding I was asking him his opinion on
      decorations and ECT. And asked what he thought, his reply,
      ""choose whatever colors you want it dosent matter to me
      anyway"". My heart stopped, I realized he will never see how
      beautiful our reception was, how pretty his sister's looked
      standing up there with us. As time went on and our children were
      born I couldn't help but think he will not be able to see the
      details in their first drawings, help them as they learned their
      colors without having to read the color written on the side of the
      crayon first. I cannot imagine how that feels to not be able to
      teach such an easy thing. And then let's be honest who hasent
      played a board game with him where he has not had to do a color
      roll call for to confirm what colors are part of the game before
      we can start. I would just love to be able to give him a little
      piece back to him compared to the many things He has given me, his
      children, family and friends. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.",https://fundrazr.com/b1HOoa

"8,130",SMA fundraising challenge. 15 PLN - £3 for Adaś.,Polish Zlotych,,of zł500k goal,88,"My name is Ania. I am proud to introduce you a brave, little boy Adaś
  who was born with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) ( http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Spinal-muscular-atrophy/pages/introduction.aspx )
   is a genetic disease that causes muscle weakness and progressive loss
  of movement. Type 1 is the most severe and in most cases causes severe
  respiratory problems which means that children rarely survive beyond
  two years of age. 1 in 5000 children is born with SMA around the world. Please join this SMA fundraising challenge and help Adaś to continue
  his experimental therapy treatment. Adaś Skrzypek  was born just
  before Christmas with the worst type of SMA, type 1. His parents were
  told that he would not reach his first birthday. The doctors informed
  them that there is no cure for SMA at the moment and all they could do
  was to wait for the worst, while his muscles slowly withered away
  until his respiratory system failed and cause Adaś to suffocate. But,
  despite terrifying diagnosis, Aneta and Tomasz Skrzypek, Adaś’s
  parents didn’t give up. They started a daily rehabilitation regime for
  Adaś and started searching around the world for a cure. Adaś's
  condition deteriorated quickly which meant he was no longer offered
  experimental therapies in Europe. He was now not able to swallow or
  breathe properly and was fitted with a tracheotomy tube. Adaś nearly
  died several times but he is a little fighter and was able to start an
  experimental therapy which his parents had found. They didn’t give up
  after being refused help in Europe and they searched around the world
  finally coming across a new treatment in America. The therapy involves
  an injection every 45 days and oral medications in between. Adaś was
  given the first injection just before he turned 6 months old. And a
  tiny mirracle had happened!! Adaś was able to breathe for 20 minutes
  all by himself for the first time in a very long time. He was also
  able to slightly move his head and suck a dummy. There is a realistic
  chance that the experimental therapy that Adaś is receiving will be
  successfull. But unfortunately the cost of the treatment have exceeded
  his parents financial capabilities. The cost of it is 80000 polish
  zlotych (£15,000) every 45 days, and this sum will increase once the
  doses get stronger. By helping Adaś, we are helping children around the world who have
  been or may be born with incurable SMA. We can make a difference and
  change the world. We are giving hope to all the parents who were told
  that the only thing they could do was to give up and wait for the
  worst. Please help by donating any amount in polish zlotych (PLN) or
  the equivalent in another currency and sharing it on Facebook. We can
  spread the word and be a part of something amazing!! We can save
  children all around the world. * You are most welcome to donate as much as you wish. FundRarz and

  szkieletowych, a w ciężkich przypadkach prowadząca do śmierci. Typ 1,
  wczesnodziecięcy jest najpoważniejszy. Objawy choroby pojawiają sie
  zaraz po urodzeniu lub do szóstego miesiąca życia. Dziecko rzadko ma
  szansę przeżycia dwóch lat. 1 na 5000 dzieci na świecie rodzi sie z SMA. Adaś Skrzypek jest malutkim chłopczykiem, który urodził się 20
  grudnia 2015 roku w Tarnowie. Adaś jest chory na SMA typ 1. Jego
  rodzice, Aneta i Tomasz Skrzypek, przed Wigilią dowiedzieli się, że
  ich długo wyczekiwany synek może nie doczekać swoich pierwszych
  urodzin. Lekarze nie dawali Adasiowi żadnych szans. Jedyne co Państwo
  Skrzypek mogli zrobić, to poddać się i czekać, aż mięśnie Adasia
  zwiotczeją, a uklad oddechowy przestanie działać i Adaś sie udusi.
  Jednak rodzice Adasia z pełną determinacją podjęli poszukiwania
  eksperymentalnej terapii w Europie, która dałaby szansę Adasiowi.
  Niestety po początkowym zakwalifikowaniu Adasia do jednej z terapii,
  stan chłopca pogorszył sie na tyle, że odmówiono jego leczenia. Adaś
  był kilka razy bliski śmierci, ale jest malutkim wojownikiem i przeżył
  po to, by móc wziąść udział w eksperymentalnej terapii, którą znaleźli
  jego rodzice. Nie poddali sie kiedy odmówiono Adasiowi leczenia w
  Europie i rozpoczęli poszukiwania na szeroką skalę na całym świecie,
  aby wreszcie znaleźć nadzieję w Ameryce. Chłopczykowi zaproponowano
  terapię w trakcie, której co 45 dni dostaje zastrzyk, a w między
  czasie przyjmuje leki doustne. Adaś pierwszy zastrzyk dostał niedługo
  przed swoim 6 miesiącem życia. I stał sie maleńki cud!! Adaś był w
  stanie samodzielnie oddychać przez 20 minut, czego nie mógł robić już
  od długiego czasu. Mógł również lekko poruszać główką i trzymać
  smoczek w buźce. Nie mógł tego robić od wielu tygodni. Jest realna
  szansa, że ta eksperymentalna terapia, której Adaś jest poddawany,
  będzie zakończona sukcesem. Niestety, koszt terapii przerósł
  możliwości finansowe rodziców Adasia. Jej koszt, to 80 tysięcy złotych
  co 45 dni. Może to ulec zwiększeniu, kiedy dozy staną się mocniejsze.
  Pomagając Adasiowi, pomagamy dzieciom na całym świecie, które już są
  lub urodzą się chore na nieuleczalną chorobę rdzeniowego zaniku mięśni
  (SMA). Możemy zmienić ich świat i dać nadzieję rodzicom, którym
  powiedziano, że jedyną rzeczą, którą mogą zrobić, to poddać się i
  czekać na najgorsze. Proszę, pomóżcie Adasiowi wpłacając datki w
  złotówkach lub ich równowartość w innych walutach i udostępniając to
  na Facebooku. Możemy rozpowszechnić informację o Adasiu i być częścią
  czegoś wspaniałego!! Możemy wspólnie uratować dzieci na całym świecie!! * Jeśli są Państwo w stanie wplacić więcej niż 2 funty, to serdecznie
  dziękujemy.

      project to understand and document disability in Haiti to help
      enhance the lives and reduce the suffering of the most vulnerable
      - persons with disabilities . Our two previous crowdfunding campaigns exceeded our goals
      through generous support and donations both on this site and
      off-line. The first helped get us started by funding travel,
      accommodation, security and expenses for our photographer, Scott
      Doubt, and I, this May . The 2nd is still paying for costs
      to produce and distribute content from that trip - stories, video
      interivews, photographic essays, articles, and for developing
      social media and web channels to grow awareness and encourage
      engagement. We also are so fortunate to have many professional
      volunteers who have contributed invaluable expertise to the project. Y ou can follow fresh stories and reports as
      they are produced on Facebook and Youtube . Our goal of $5,000.00 for this campaign is higher

      including a volunteer videographer (along with a photographer) on
      our November trip. We hope that you  will also help by raising
      awareness and increasing support for abilityhaiti among your networks. It will
      take all your help to grow a larger supporter base as the project
      grows and produces more outcomes.  By investing your support from
      the beginning, you will be contributing to the sustainability of
      this continuous multi-media documentation. Life is hard in Haiti, even with incremental progress
  since the earthquake of 2010. Yet, Haitians are the most wonderful,
  resilient and proud people. Living with a disability in a developing country is
  often a brutal struggle. Yet, those I've met are among the bravest,
  most beautiful people I know. Thank you for your support.",https://fundrazr.com/619m45

  teachers at Chehalem Elementary and we have way too much fun teaching
  our 500 wonderful students together. We often have ideas that involve using a projector screen. Due to the
  nature of our gym and stage situation, we are unable to use a
  projector set-up because the chords would be a tripping hazard to
  students. We also would like to use a projector during the morning
  times to get the kids moving several days a week before classes begin. Therefore a rear facing projector screen with an Apple TV hooked up
  to the projector would be an amazing addition to our Physical
  Education program as well as a helpful tool for the whole school to
  use every day.  We would have a projector set-up behind the rear
  screen on the stage so no chords would be on the gym floor. We have
  access to iPads that we would airplay through the Apple TV onto the
  screen. The possibilities are endless for a system like this in our gymnasium. We would greatly appreciate your help in funding our project and
  sharing it with your friends and family.  We look forward to all the
  benefits these learning tools will provide all students at Chehalem.

    ביבי והליכוד קובעת עבורו ועבור עוד 800 אלף נכים ו120 אלף קשישים??
    כאשר הסברתי לשרים, מפלגות וקבוצות בפייסבוק שאנשים מתים מרעב כנראה שלא מבינים  את ההיקף או את החומרה בדבריי.... ישראל 2017 -אנשים
    בעלי מוגבלות נאבקים כדי לשרוד! ואם יש משפחה או חברים - זו לא אחריותם
    לטפל ולרוב - נכים מקבלים יחס מפלה גם ממשפחתם - לעד לבד... השאלה היא
    לא האם ישנם תקציבים או לא - ידוע כבר שכאשר רוצים משיגים בקלות...
    השאלה היא מי מהממשלה הנוכחית נרתם באמת למאבק - תשובה קצרה לי -אף

    מאחר וכחלון וביבי יודעים שאין מה ""למהר"" הם ייקחו את הזמן

    במשך חודשים, מה זה שהמשפחה והסביבה לא סופרת אותך ממטר \ לא מתעניינת
    כלל בקשיים שיש לאדם נכה, ואין ממי לבקש עזרה.. אז החלטתי לנסות

"6,985",MONSTER INSIDE- Spine Fusion Metal Implant Allergy,U.S. Dollar,,of $25k goal,13,"URGENT: My name is Lana Sinclair, I thank you for taking time to read
  this. My son Richard had a spinal fusion and found out he is allergic
  to the metal hardware holding his spine together. He is suffering
  tremendously from a metal MONSTER INSIDE his spine that triggered auto
  immune disease and unbearable pain. I humbly ask for your support and
  need donations for expenses to go to Los Angeles, California to get
  urgent specialized medical treatment and surgery to remove the toxic metal. His story is lengthy, but I felt it was very important to share
  information and raise awareness in medical community and public
  about metal implant allergy, a MONSTER INSIDE. RICHARD'S STORY: In September 2011 Richard was injured in a car accident. The auto
  insurance company was not cooperative and refused to authorize payment
  for treatment.  His only option was county health plan and he had to
  see the doctor they assigned. It did not cover any treatment he
  needed. His condition rapidly deteriorated. After being in pain and
  asking for months he finally had an MRI. The results showed spine
  abnormalities and he was referred to an orthopedic surgeon for a
  lumbar spine microdiskectomy in March 2013. The county health
  insurance would not cover physical therapy. I lost my job for needing
  to take time off to assist my son, and had to move immediately. I had
  bought Richard a classic car for his 16th birthday, he had it for 12
  years. Richard loved that car but sold it to help pay to move to a
  place that would allow our beloved pets ... to this day I am sick at
  heart he had to. In September of 2013, 6 months after surgery, the insurance finally
  approved physical therapy. The very first day of pool therapy, the
  disc previously operated on herniated. I was at work, Richard barely
  made it home and called me and said something was wrong, he couldn't
  walk. I rushed home and called an ambulance. The ER staff said they
  didn't know what was wrong, the MRI looked ok and kept him overnight
  for observation. I went home to check the pets and get some sleep. My
  son called me the next morning, said they discharged him saying it was
  a pulled muscle. He told me he kept begging them to listen, he was in
  agony and they made him get up when he could barely walk. He was in a wheelchair waiting outside the hospital when I arrived to
   pick him up. I didn't know what to do or think. I barely got him in
  the van to to go home. It took 1/2 hour to go from the van into the
  house and help him lay on the bed. He could not get up and was
  screaming in pain. I called ambulance again and demanded they take him
  to a different hospital. We told the ER doctor what happened, he
  checked the medical system and came back and told us the other
  hospital read the wrong MRI, the lumbar disc was badly herniated. They
  did not have the facilities to do anything, he had no choice but to
  send my son back to the first hospital by ambulance to have surgery. The previous surgeon was called in to see Richard and told him he had
  to have lumbar spinal fusion, with metal rods and screws to stabilize
  the lower spine. He operated the next day and Richard was discharged
  in 23 hours because insurance wouldn't pay for longer stay. Almost
  immediately Richard complained of a different kind of pain and there
  was a strange discharge from the incision. After returning home the following day,
  Richard's entire lower back was swollen and severely
  bruised. I freaked out when I saw how bad it was and called the
  surgeon's office.  I described the swelling, bruising and heavy
  discharge, I had to change dressing frequently. I wanted to take him
  to the doctor but Richard wasn't supposed to ride in a car that soon
  after surgery.  The nurse said it was nothing to worry about. I was
  persistent and took my son to the surgeon's office and demanded they
  do something, his back was horrific looking. The surgeon had a shocked
  look on his face when he saw how bad it was and extracted several
  viles of ""fluid"" from his back. They gave him antibiotics
  and sent him home. The incision finally healed but Richard did not
  feel good and he complained about a ""different"" kind of
  pain. The doctor said it was going to take time before it got better!
  He was told to follow up with family doctor after that, due to
  insurance they would not be able to see him. We got notice to vacate because our rental was sold. We had to move 2
  weeks after Richard's 2nd surgery October 2013. By the grace of God we
  found a landlord with a soft heart willing to work with us and allow
  pets and our neighbors helped us move. The last 4 years since the spinal fusion have been a living hell for
  Richard. After the 2nd surgery Richard began experiencing bizarre
  immune reactions and digestive problems. Not only has he suffered
  physically, but the relentless pain has taken a toll on him. He went
  from being healthy, active and happy to being held captive of the
  pain, going to from the bed, the chair, the couch, constantly changing
  positions, unable to sleep well or relieve the constant gnawing
  burning stabbing pain. Richard always loved being around a lot of
  people, and he has been isolated by his illness. His cat Bud is his
  constant companion and best friend. My son went to the ER for unexplained swelling and acute pain flare
  ups. My son's concerns and symptoms were ignored and he was referred
  to pain counseling...because they did not see anything they assumed it
  was ""all in his head"". Richard waited months for
  appointments, I have taken him to every major medical facility in
  Michigan in search of help and relief. Nothing offered helped.  One
  painful and frustrating dead end after another, paying out of pocket
  for expenses, travel and treatment. My son continued to suffer because
  (1) doctor wouldn't accept insurance, (2) denied coverage for doctor
  ordered treatment or (3) did not cover much if any (4) would not
  listen/test/investigate symptoms. Despite exhausting every possible option we could think of nothing
  helped,  Richard's symptoms got worse and worse.  My son was told he
  had failed fusion syndrome and some people have a lot of pain
  afterward and he would have to learn how to cope with it.  One doctor
  said they were going to ""rip out the old hardware and put new
  fusion hardware in the rest of his spine"". Others said everything
  looked good go to pain counseling, it's all in your head. It was
  dehumanizing, frustrating and terrifying because every opinion my son
  got was something totally different. Who was right? Were they all wrong? My dear daughter had done her best to help her brother Richard
  throughout the ordeal. She too became ill during this time and had to
  have surgery. She had genetic testing for tendency for certain
  illnesses, she shared an article about it. I wanted to help and
  understand what she was dealing with and began to read medical
  research articles, and one day by chance, I tripped across an article
  on metal allergy. MONSTER INSIDE: The article was about a ""MELISA test"". A
  very comprehensive blood test that can detect if a person has metal
  sensitivity to a wide spectrum of surgical and dental implant metals.
  I then searched and found case studies written by doctors on patients
  who had a wide variety of bizarre auto-immune response symptoms
  including uncontrollable pain caused by metal implant devices. It was
  as if I was reading a story about my son. I also learned that metal
  surgical devices used have the potential for allergic reaction and
  patients should be tested PRIOR to surgery. Not one of the medical
  facilities I had taken my son to had ever investigated a possible
  allergy to the metal implant hardware. The side effects from prolonged
  exposure to metal toxicity are VERY VERY serious. Richard went to a special clinic to be tested, the results came
  back.. he tested POSITIVE for Titanium allergy. Most surgical metals
  and alloy components break down and corrode over time when exposed to
  body fluid and tissue, emitting particles into the body and triggering
  immune response. I was appalled to learn that Richard had not been
  tested prior to surgery, even though I later learned the implant
  manufacturer WARNED that patients should be tested and the device
  should be removed as soon as the bone had fused (healed). My son had
  it in his body for almost 4 years!!! The thought of what would have
  happened if that one doctor had fused the rest of his spine with the
  same metal made me nauseous. It was surreal to find out what had been causing the horrific pain
  and symptoms but it quickly changed to ""Oh my God, what can be
  done now? Who can help my son?"" When it comes to the Spine, there
  is absolutely no room for a mistake if my son was going to have a
  chance. I contacted previous medical providers with no success. I
  began calling all over the state and country looking for surgeons.
  Finding anyone with expertise that would work with the insurance
  situation has been a long dragged out nightmare,  Many of the doctors
  offices had never heard of metal allergy,  some did not believe us,
  some would not take complicated cases. I am scared if the wrong
  surgeon operated it could do irreversible damage and permanently
  cripple my son. I contacted the top hospitals across the country and asked for help.
  Expert spine reconstruction surgeons affiliated with top hospital
  in Los Angeles, CA can help my son. It will take an expert surgeon to
  remove the hardware, access any damage to surrounding tissue from
  prolonged exposure to toxic metal and determine if it may require a
  second non-metal spine stabilization surgery. There is a team of other
  doctors available to help with immune and other metal toxicity related issues. My son's health and future is at stake. This is a nightmare, I need
  your help. The financial strain has been increasingly difficult.  I
  was fired twice because I had to take time off, we were forced to move
  twice, the out of pocket expense for medicine, treatments, travel and
  doctor visits has been astronomical. I became self employed to be able
  to work from home but will have no income to maintain my home in
  Michigan for 3 months plus the cost to stay in California is so very
  expensive. I gratefully and humbly appreciate donations to help with
   lodging, adjustable bed, transportation, meals and non-covered
  medical. My best conservative estimate it could easily exceed $25,000. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Please Share. *METAL ALLERGY INFO: The symptoms are often overlooked. I know there
  are other people out there that are sick and in pain, suffering
  auto-immune disease and they don't know it could be caused by a metal
  implant, dental work or other surgical device. Go to MELISA.org for
  info. I hope sharing this story will spread awareness in the medical
  community and public. Please share with your loved ones, ask for a
  metal sensitivity / allergy test before any dental or surgical implant.",https://fundrazr.com/b1HI85

Keeney Ride To Give 3.0 4065 Kelly Meredith Ride To Give 3.0 4065 George Abrams 1108 Erik and Patty Heine of Oklahoma City, OK were excited to welcome
  their first child, a son Stephen, in 2007. After he was born, the
  Heines observed Stephen had broad thumbs and toes, which they found
  odd but endearing. He also had a LOT of hair! From birth, Stephen
  struggled with feeding which caused him to have trouble gaining
  weight. It was frustrating, but they chalked it up to reflux and enjoy
  their sweet new baby. As he grew, Stephen hit his milestones on time, but always at the
  late end of the ""normal"" range. When Stephen was nine months
  old, he had hernia surgery, which led to the discovery of a heart
  murmur and a kidney abnormality. Following surgery, Stephen's physical
  development stalled, and at one year old, he was referred for Early
  Intervention for therapies. There were still lingering
    questions about his health issues, and after additional testing,
    Stephen was diagnosed with Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome in
    May of 2008. Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome , a
  genetic disorder which affects approximately 1:250,000 births, is
  characterized by short stature, moderate to severe intellectual
  disability, distinctive facial features, and broad thumbs and first
  toes. Additional features of the disorder can include eye
  abnormalities, heart and kidney defects, dental problems, and obesity.
  These signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals. People with
  this condition have an increased risk of developing noncancerous and
  cancerous tumors, including certain kinds of brain tumors. Cancer of
  blood-forming tissue (leukemia) also occurs more frequently in people
  with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome. Infants born with this severe form of
  the disorder usually survive only into early childhood. Thankfully Stephen’s overall health has balanced out, and he
    is a happy and thriving 4th grader. Currently, Stephen receives private physical and occupational
  therapies, as well as physical, occupational, and speech therapy in
  his school setting.  To meet his goals of independence as an adult,
  Stephen spends approximately 3/4 of his school day with his typically
  developing peers, in the regular education classroom. Also, he has
  difficulty communicating verbally, so he uses Proloquo2Go software on an iPad
  mini to communicate. Doctors have not given the Heines a timeline as to what they should
  expect with Stephen, so they take everything one day at a time.
  They're determined to not let their child's disability or illness keep
  them from doing the things they love and find a way to adapt and make
  that activity possible. Erik is an avid runner, and for years it has
  been an activity he can share with Stephen. Up until recently, they
  have been able to use a traditional running stroller which Stephen has
  now out grown and is not 100% safe for him. After much research, Eric
  found the Blade at www.hoytrunningchairs.com . Hoyt Running Chairs designs and
    manufactures state-of-the-art racing chairs for individuals with
    disabilities. As a subdivision of Southbridge Tool &
    Manufacturing , they are able to custom build each chair to the
    comfort and needs of both the rider and the runner. They pride
    themselves on getting to know their clients and providing them with
    the ultimate racing experience. Mike Didonato , the president of Southbridge
    Tool & Manufacturing first heard the story of Rick and Dick Hoyt in 2009. Dick Hoyt has pushed his son Rick,
      who was diagnosed a spastic quadriplegic with cerebral palsy after
      his birth in 1962, in over 1,000 races including marathons,
      triathlons, and 6 Ironman races. Their story inspired Mike,
    and a few months later he happened to meet Dick Hoyt at a local
    grocery store. Mike mentioned his family’s manufacturing company and
    offered to fix Rick’s chair if needed. The next year, Dick Hoyt
    showed up at Southbridge Tool and Manufacturing and asked if a brand
    new chair could be built for Rick because he was very uncomfortable
    in his original chair. The Signature was built in time for the Hoyts to compete in the 2010 Boston Marathon . The chair was
    beautifully built for comfort, speed, and maneuverability. Soon,
    other teams and families began asking for a chair. In 2014, Mike was
    approached by Nick Sotar , a retired bicycle shop owner, who
    admired The Signature but had some ideas to improve the design. Nick
    presented Mike with a design for a revolutionary new racing chair
    called The Blade , which is easily
    disassembled and can be shipped in a bike box. After Stephen was diagnosed with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome at 18
  months old, it took almost seven years before they were able to get
  him on non-income-based Medicaid. As a result, the Heines ate through
  their entire family savings paying for medical bills and therapies
  even with insurance. Unfortunately, the cost of a Blade racing
    wheelchair is approximately 10% of Erik’s gross annual
  salary as a Professor of Music at Oklahoma City University ,
  and not something they have sitting around or in a savings account.
  The Blade has not been deemed ""essential"" by their
  insurance. However, Stephen's Occupational and Physical Therapists
  both believe that a chair that he can use for over a decade IS
  essential to helping him relieve stress and participate in an outdoor
  activity like his typically-developing peers. Ride to Give agrees and wants to provide Stephen with a custom
    built Blade that will fit him perfectly and will be used for years
    to come. Our mission at RTG is to turn athletic ability into
  fundraising power for families with children who are disabled,
  injured, or ill.  We think Stephen and Erik will make fantastic
  ambassadors for Team Ride to Give and we can’t wait to see them race
  for the first time with their new Hoyt Running Chair . Please help us purchase the
  Blade running chair and accessories for Stephen by making a tax
  deductible donation to Ride to Give. At this time, Stephen does not have a Facebook Page of his
    own, so follow Ride to GIve on Facebook for all updates. Contributions are solicited with the understanding that the

365,Battle Batten with us,Pound Sterling,,of £100k goal,15,"Amazing parents Andrew and Sarah are raising funds to help their
  beautiful twin boys Freddie and Louie, and other children suffering
  from the rare, degenerative condition, CLN5 Batten disease. Freddie and Louie Dawkins are the only known twins in the world with
  this rare form of a rare disease. Born perfectly healthy in 2005, they
  became autistic, blind and recently developed epilepsy. When they were
  diagnosed in 2009, doctors said that without major advancements in
  medical science, there was no hope, no treatment and no cure. In February 2014 Andrew and Sarah decided to fight back through
  ‘Battle Batten’ their very own campaign to exclusively raise money for
  research into CLN5 Batten disease. Originally aiming for just £1,000, they have so far raised an
  incredible £80,000 and unbelievably commissioned two research
  projects. They are the first UK family to privately commission
  research into CLN5 Batten disease; donating funds to the Batten
  Disease Family Association (BDFA), a charity who is managing the
  projects on the family’s behalf. The cash raised in just 12 months has been unexpected, and
  emotionally overwhelming for the family and still, the momentum and
  passion is strong. The family will continue to fundraise for as long
  as they can. Proceeds will be donated to research projects and will
  buy equipment that best offers hope to children with CLN5, including
  Freddie and Louie.",https://fundrazr.com/611LCf

    each other or slight variations. He often tells me about how in

  surgery which just occurred this past July 2017. Yes, my third

  found strength through prayer and meditation, your kind words and
  encouragement and my own inner strength. My recovery from surgery will
  take anywhere from 6 months to a year.  Though my health insurance
  covered some of my surgery, it will not cover all of my medical cost
  including my physical therapy cost which I'm currently enrolled in.  I
  set up this fundraising page as a way to not only raise money towards
  my medical expenses but to also keep family, friends and colleagues
  updated on my recovery journey. I'm humbly reaching out to you all for your financial support.
  Anything you donate is more appreciated than you can imagine, as I'm
  grateful for the smallest amount of help you may be able to lend to my
  fundraising effort. Who is E.K. ""Terri"" Braswell ? I currently reside in Washington, DC's Reed-Cooke neighborhood -

  did not plan or could ever imagine. So is the case with me being
  diagnosed with Sarcoidosis with advanced Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
  in 2013. A disease that until then I had never heard about. Two years,
  blood tests, numerous x-rays, an open lung biopsy, CT scans, lots of
  visits to the specialist and all kinds of medications later, reality
  finds me practically house-bound on oxygen therapy learning to adjust
  to my new normal.” -Excerpt from Rosemarie Hartnick’s Blog, https://rosemariehartnick.wordpress.com Rosemarie Hartnick is a mother of two stunning boys, Ross and Connor,
  and wife to Pastor Brian Hartnick. Anyone who knows her can attest to
  the driven, selfless, motivating person that she is. Living with
  Pulmonary fibrosis for the past 4 years has taken its toll on her
  family but she refuses to become a victim of her circumstance Pulmonary fibrosis is a disease marked by scarring of the tissue
  inside and between the air sacs in the lungs. When the scar forms, the
  tissue becomes stiff and thicker. This makes it harder for oxygen to
  pass through the walls of the air sac into the bloodstream. Once the
  lung tissue becomes scarred, the damage cannot be reversed. There is
  no cure. Many people with the disease live only about three to five
  years after diagnosis. As a friend and mentee of Rosmarie Hartnick, I am, with a few of my
  friends and family looking to help in any way that I can. The family
  is in need of a portable oxygen machine, a wheelchair, and help with
  month on month medical expenses. Rosemarie has recently undergone some
  rigorous testing at the Groote Schuur Hospital where she may undergo
  the very first double lung transplant to be carried out at the facility. Through a benefit concert, taking place on 1st October 2017,  and
  other efforts, we are looking to raise R50,000 for the Hartnick Family. We need your help to accomplish this. Would you consider donating in
  cash, kind, or time to help us achieve this mission? Please see the
  appendix for donation information. We thank you in advance for your support! Your donation is greatly
  appreciated and will be used to obtain a portable oxygen machine and
  wheelchair for Rosemarie and to cover a portion of the family’s
  medical bills. Please send an email to kasuba.sikamo@gmail.com for more information.",https://fundrazr.com/e1HLZb

  enjoys reading, video games, hanging out with his friends, and, like
  most kids, fighting with his brother and sister. In October 2011, Sebastian was diagnosed with Stage IV
  Neuroblastoma, a cancer that starts in the nerve cells, and is rarely
  found in children over the age of 4. He is nearing the end of a long,
  difficult road. His initial treatments were at St. Louis
    Childrens. He has endured 6 rounds of high-dosage chemotherapy, a
    bone marrow transplant, 18 bone marrow biopsies, a major surgery to
    remove a large mass from his abdomen, and countless tests and scans.
    He had 2 rounds of mibg radiation therapy in Cincinnati, OH, and 40
    rounds of palliative radiation at Carle Hospital in Champaign, IL.
    He also received treatment at Comer Children's Hospital in Chicago,
    where he had a team of oncologists who specialize in Neuroblastoma.
    We were unable to improve his disease. In July 2014, following
    complications due to chemo, Sebastian decided to stop treatment.

135,Cannabis Therapeutics Certification,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,7,"This year we are celebrating 15 years since the American
    Alliance for Medical Cannabis was founded. Dr. Jay Cavanaugh created
    AAMC to help patients and to educate health professionals, lawmakers
    and the general public about the therapeutic uses of Cannabis. We
    have come a long way since 2001. We now have AAMC Directors in 21
    States, and 26 States plus the District of Columbia have legal
    medical marijuana. The most common question patients ask is “Where can I find a
    doctor who can help me?” Most doctors have not had a chance to learn
    about medical cannabis. They didn’t learn about the endocannabinoid
    system in medical school and they are reluctant to talk about it. The American Alliance for Medical Cannabis is dedicated to
    helping patients. We need your support to increase our staff so that
    we can identify qualified health professionals and provide patients
    with quality medical care. By becoming AAMC certified clinics, health professionals will
    demonstrate that they are informed about the therapeutic use of
    Cannabis. AAMC is trusted by patients. We understand the needs of
    patients. Patients will know that they are being cared for by
    competent doctors. Patients have the right to talk about their use
    of Cannabis with people who know that it’s not just for fun. Our goal is to develop clinics where patients can get complete
    medical care from doctors who know how Cannabis helps. If you would
    like to help, please give AAMC a generous donation today. AAMC certified clinics provide: * Knowledgeable doctors and nurses * Cannabis is part of initial treatment plan when indicated. * Clinics are typical doctor's offices * Full service health care The goal is to develop clinics that have knowledgeable staff to
    deliver patient care.",https://fundrazr.com/MedicalCannabis

      ""does this match""? Although it's sort of cute to see the
      types of things he pairs together, it's time he literally gets to
      see for himself. The glasses themselves are $349 plus an additional $150 for a

"3,153",Support Black Panther Robert Seth Hayes!,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,74,"Robert Seth Hayes is one of the longest held political prisoners in
  the US. After returning from the Vietnam War, Seth joined the Black
  Panther Party and was later imprisoned for his involvement in the
  struggle for Black Liberation. Seth was sentenced to 25 years to life, which means after
  serving 25 years he is eligible for parole. Seth has now been locked
  in prison for 42 years and unjustly denied parole on 10 occasions.
  Seth has a large and loving family and supportive community who yearn
  for his release. Seth turns 67 this year and suffers from multiple
  chronic medical problems. We are waging a campaign for Seth concerning his ailing health.
  With proper medical care, Seth's health issues could be under control
  but the horribly inadequate health care during his incarceration
  places him at grave risk. The combination of repetitive parole denials
  and neglectful medical care equates to a extrajudicial death sentence
  for Seth. In addition struggling to receive medical care, Seth is also
  fighting for his constitutional rights at the parole board. Seth is a
  model prisoner and meets all criteria for release, yet has been
  repetitively denied parole for no other reason than ""the serious
  nature of the original crime."" This essentially means that the
  Parole Board is taking it upon themselves to re-sentence Seth to life
  in prison without the possibility parole. Seth is challenging this
  violation of his constitutional rights with a Habeas petition. Seth needs our support. Please make a contribution to this
  campaign to win justice and freedom for a brother who has sacrificed
  so much for us all!",https://fundrazr.com/810a58

  remove the tumours whenever needed to preserve my life. In the end of 2017, I need to undergo surgery again to remove
  multiple large tumours called schwannoma from both my arms. They have
  made my fingers and hands increasingly numb. If they are not carefully
  removed, they can paralyze my arms. I cannot become incapacitated, my mother will be helpless if I lose
  the ability to take care of myself. Last year, I had brain surgery at
  the US NIH, the surgery was done well. However, I was not taken cared
  of well in the ward. My vision became damaged as a result, I have had
  to adapt by getting help from people to do my work and in order to
  stay productive, while my mother started having to prepare my daily
  living needs despite her advanced age.  So I must go for surgery with
  doctors who can do better to save my arms before it is too late. Some brief details about the surgery: Where: St Vincent Medical Center, Los Angeles. By Who: Dr. Gregory P Lekovic, Neurosurgeon.

      pleasure of being a daughter and an Aunt to wonderful people. My
      father is in his 60s and has spent his entire life not being able
      to see all the colors in the rainbow. He has had carpenter jobs

      him to be able to add colors to his art and not have limitations.
      My two nephews will also spend a life without all the colors
      unless we can change that. The other day I pointed out a rainbow
      that was in the sky before I realized that they might not see it.
      The rainbow was faint appearing. My nephew must have stared in the
      sky for a good ten minutes trying to see it all. I want to give
      the gift of color vision to my family. Please contribute by

    in October and friends for 6 years. Michael has worked since he was
    14. He had a great work ethic and worked not only his full time job
    but side jobs. He was a mechanic and painter a nd
    his main career was for 30+years as a Manager and District Manager
    in the Grocery field. In September 2015 his life was changed forever. As he was
    closing at his new job for the night, two armed men came in and
    robbed the store. He was beaten for over 20 minutes against the safe
    and with the handgun. Michael has had both knees operated on due to
    being slammed to the floor numerous times. He now has black out
    seizures, some are in the brain and many of the seizures are Grand
    Mal. In April of this year I came home to find him in a continual
    seizure episode. He was hospitilized and in ICU. His hospital stay
    ran for a week and I lost income due to having to stay with him. His
    diagnosis is TBI, PTSD and 80% loss of hearing on his left side (we
    are awaiting surgery on that issue); he will never be able to work
    according to his Doctors and he is unable to drive so, we have to
    pay for his rides to therapy, Doctors visits etc. Our medical bills are mounting and there has been no place to
    go for needed items. We have applied for his SSD but they are in the
    hearing stage which can be another 18 months. We have monthly
    expenses for monitors to keep him safe, and the loss of his income
    has left us with no savings and behind on bills. We have filed for
    everything under the sun but we are still waiting, with no end in
    sight. Our needs are to pay his medical bills, maintain payment on
    his fall detection monitor, get him a new cane and pay for the
    numerous supplements that he has to take. If all bills get paid with
    this campaign, I'd also be exlploring hyperbaric treatment; studies

225,PLEASE HELP my son see Disney in FULL COLOR!,U.S. Dollar,"Nov 22, 2017",of $349 goal,6,"About us... We are a family of 6 on one
        income. I am a stay at home mom of 4 amazing kids. I have one
        daughter who is 17.  I have two middle sons, ages 14 and 13.
        They have autistic disorders but have come a LONG way with all
        the help and support of friends, family, teachers, coaches,
        therapist and God. Then we had Kyle.  Kyle is our first son who
        is ""normal"" and now I just found out he is moderate
        Protan color blind. Protan is one of the rarer type (1% of color
        blind people are protan).  What does that mean?  Well anything
        with red in it he doesn't see correctly. Purples look blue b/c the red portion of the color purple is
        missing. Red sometimes looks black . Orange and green can look
        like each other. Most stuff looks like a weird brownish green . His world is
        shades of brown/green with blue , yellow , black and white. It breaks my heart because I
        LOVE colors.  I love r a i n b o w s , and crystals and holiday decorations. I love
        fall leaves, flowers , fireworks and M & M's . How do these things
        look to him?  Probably dreary. Kyle is 8 years old and is in
        3rd grade. He LOVES riding his dirt bike , playing soccer,
        building things and helping his dad with what ever project he is
        working on. He is a dare devil and talks nonstop.  We suspected
        for years that he may be colorblind but we didn't understand the
        condition. So when we would do our little tests and ask him
        ""What color is this?"", if he got it right, we assumed
        he could see fine and must be playing a trick on us. Now I get
        it, and it's not that simple. He has learned what we call red and what we call orange.  He
        doesn't however see it like we do.  In fact they are all so
        close in color to him he has a hard time telling them apart at
        all. It all depends on the lighting and how far away the thing
        is. Color blindness runs in my
          family and on my husbands side as well, but we thought we were
          in the clear. Maybe in denial. After having some teachers
          voice their concerns, and the many times he called something
          the wrong color, we  finally just had him
        tested...twice.  I believe it now. It's effecting his school
        situations as well as his sports.  And I would assume,  just his
        everyday enjoyment of life. I know he doesn't know what he's
        missing, but I do. We take seeing in color for granted. Color
        brings joy to us though.  I have probably done all I can to help
        my older boys with their autism, I'd like to do what I can to
        help Kyle. This fundraiser is to raise
          money to buy Kyle a pair of glasses that will help him
        see the colors he's missing.  It helps 75% of people who try
        them.  We have been saving for a few years and we are finally
        taking our kids to Florida for a week in November of this year.
        Kyle's 9th birthday is during this week. We will be spending his
        whole birthday at Disney's Magic Kingdom! We are also going to
        Disney's Animal Kingdom, the ocean, and
          Universal Studio's islands of adventure.  I would LOVE for him
          to see Disney, Universal and the beach in all it's glory with a pair of these glasses. He will also get to see the
        fireworks in full color! PLEASE help my son! Any donation no

"1,600",PLEASE HELP SAVE MY MOM,Canadian Dollar,,of $20k goal,13,"OUR GAME PLAN We are looking into effective alternative treatments to try to
    save Mom's life. She needs cancer-killing herbs, roots, oils, a raw
    foods diet, and we might even consider a trip to the States to a
    cancer clinic that has had a high success rate in treating people
    with cancer, plus we’re trying to get her moved back to B.C. so she can be
    near to family during this difficult time. The costs she faces are considerable, and unfortunately,
    alternative treatments aren’t recognized or covered under most
    health plans, and standard treatments also entail costs, both of
    which are looming on the horizon. Mom has grappled with health problems for years and suffers with
    pain each day, and yet in spite of this, she has reached out to help
    others heal emotionally. I’m praying that in her time of need, her friends and
    acquaintances will come to her aid. This would pave the way for her to get the treatments she needs
    to win this terrible battle she faces. ABOUT MY MOM From an early age, Mom shared a deep bond with animals. She
    traveled to the tropics and was captivated by the parrots there. In
    later years, she worked with abused parrots and rehabilitated them,
    teaching them to trust and love again. My mom has always been deeply touched by music and she is a
    talented guitarist and plays the piano. One of her favorite piano
    pieces is Clair de Lune by Debussy. She’s also an author and needs more time to finish and publish
    the books she was working on before she fell ill. She is my mother and a loving grandmother and we don't want her
    life cut short, nor have her torn away from us. One of her greatest
    wishes is to have more years to spend with us. LET’S HELP MAKE HER WISHES COME TRUE If you decide to donate to this fundraiser, any gift, whether
    large or small, will be deeply appreciated, and we thank you from
    the bottom of our hearts. Your actions may make a huge difference to
    Mom’s life and to all those who care about her and who don’t want to

  the emergency room dept after collapsing at home, while battling with
  what he was told by a walk-in clinic doctor, was nothing more than a flu. For 15 days, Paul was in a medically induced coma and on life support
  while doctors were frantically fighting to save his life!! Paul was infected by a bacteria called ""Invasive Group A
  Strep"", and went into Septic Shock after the bacteria infected
  his blood and his organs began to shut down, from Toxic Shock Syndrome
  (read more here: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/what-you-need-to-know-about-group-a-strep-infections/article34391674/ ). 5 out of 100,000 Canadians suffer from this per year. Paul is currently still in ICU at Scarborough General Hospital after
  being transferred there from Toronto General Hospital, and is at risk
  for organ damage in his lungs and heart, his kidneys are functioning
  at 0% capacity, and his lower limbs are at risk for amputation. He is
  currently on daily dialysis, and has not recovered most of his
  physical abilities. Paul is a healthy, 31 year old substitute elementary school teacher.
  He loves teaching younger children and especially loves sports, namely
  soccer, where he volunteered his time to coach 4 teams, ranging from
  ages 12 -16. He is also in the process of completing his
  professional refereeing licenses. Paul recently purchased his first home, a condo close to home, where
  he was planning to move in after completion in 2 years. Our mother has been by his side each and every day and night, leaving
  her job to do what a mother does, care for their sick child. Your help and generosity will ensure all of Paul and our family's
  future financial expenses and medical costs are covered, namely the
  3-6 months of rehab and prosthetic costs, Paul and our mother's time
  away from work (neither has any benefits), and you will also ensure
  Paul will not lose his first home that he worked very hard to obtain! Our little brother has kept his spirits up, and has fought so hard to
  get this far.... But a new fight begins with new challenges and
    a long road ahead... Please share your prayers and financial support

  stalked, I was raped, and survived an attempt to drug me and leave me
  in a trap-house by certain individuals, some of whom have personally
  *claimed* connection to my ex-wife's family. For the past 10 months, this has left me mentally shattered,
  without support from many of my previous network who have withdrawn
  from me on account of respectability politics and rumors, and moving
  from place to place all over the country in an attempt to find any
  sense of stability and rebuild my life, which has made finding
  additional work (which was previously unnecessary), incredibly
  difficult when coupled with the obstacles my transness and

  Adjustment Disorder, which I am also currently unable to afford
  treament for), already place on me. I am raising these funds to afford my medically necessary, and

  like having to crowdfund for this need, it's a huge blow to the pride
  I take in my work, and myself, but I also recognize that in a
  situation like this, it is important to be able to recognize when I
  *must* swallow my pride and seek the help I need. I know that my
  friends and family care about my wellbeing, and recognize that this is
  not a matter of choice, or comfort, but an unfortunate medical need on
  the basis of my inherent biology, having been born the way I was, and
  I know that with your help, we can get me back on track. Thank you for
  your help during this difficult transitionary phase. (No pun intended)",https://fundrazr.com/DeliaMelodyHRTFund

  that always looses at kickball... I don't know what it's like to win,
  so I have nothing to compare it too. Remember growing up and your
  parents always told you, you could be anything you wanted to be when
  you grew up? Now imagine you wanted to be a... 1. Police Officer 2. Doctor 3. Pilot 4. Infantry Soldier 5. Paramedic 6. Electrician 7. Painter 8. ...and the list goes on and on. Im 35 years old and despite the odds, I've managed to be a painter,
  a handyman electrician, and yes even an Airborne Infantryman in the
  United States Army (shhh don't tell them.) Truth be told I've led a pretty awesome and eventful life thus far.
  I've never let my color blindness hold me back at anything I've set
  out to do. I've remained determined in all of my goals I've set for
  myself, but I've always thought what it must be like to see the world
  the way others see it. People always ask what it's like to be color
  blind? And I always reply, I can't answer because I don't know what
  it's like to be color proficient. Enchroma has created glasses which enhance color vision without
  the compromise of color accuracy. For the first time in history I have
  the opportunity to answer that question. Please help me out. These
  glasses are not cheap, but it's a small price to pay to give the gift
  of vision. I thank you all for your consideration. Check out these reactions",https://fundrazr.com/c1IFmc

"7,690",Please help us fund Michelle's Heart Transplant,Canadian Dollar,"Jul 1, 2018",of $30k goal,50,"Do you know Michelle, like I know Michelle? I first met Michelle
  almost 8 years ago when we were taking a course together. We became
  fast friends as we shared a love of family, food and life. Her
  positive and caring spirit along with her amazing sense of humor have
  always inspired me. She has made a career as an incredibly talented
  Stylist and has shared her passion with a great many colleagues and
  students over the past 23 years. Just over a year ago, upon returning home from a business trip to
  California, Michelle started experiencing minor symptoms of not
  feeling well and knew that something was off. There is no way any of
  us could have predicted what would follow. It turned out that Michelle
  was in Congestive Heart Failure and was taken by Air Ambulance out of
  Williams Lake so that further diagnostic tests could be performed. Her
  husband Jamie was working out in the middle of the Chilcoltin and it
  was uncertain if we would be able to contact him. By the efforts of an
  amazing friend, he was reached and given the shocking news that his
  wife was in Cardiac Failure. The results of these early test had her
  referred to much more specialized Doctors in Vancouver at St. Paul's
  Hospital. She was admitted to hospital to undergo more specialized and
  invasive tests and underwent surgery to implant a Cardiac
  Defibrillator. Immediately prior to discharge Michelle was informed
  that she would need to have a Heart Transplant and that she would need
  to be on a regimen of extensive medications and dietary restrictions
  to stabilize her heart while we waited for transplant. This was
  shocking news to say the least. Michelle had been tested from an early
  age on a regular basis because a heart condition ran in her family.
  Her older brother died of a sudden cardiac event at age 15 in 1982 and
  her Father in January of 1990. No cardiac symptoms presented in
  Michelle and by age 32 she figured that she didn't have the genetic
  defect, and like so many others, found herself without a Family
  Physician so did not undergo further cardiac testing for over a decade. Michelle has not been able to work since May of 2016 and has had to
  travel to Vancouver from Williams Lake several times over the last
  year to see the team of Transplant Doctors. With becoming a single
  income household, she is anxious as to how to pay for the upcoming
  expenses that will be incurred for Transplant, a burden she does not
  want to leave to her Husband, Jamie, to figure out. Recently Michelle and Jamie were evacuated from their home due to the
  wildfires surrounding their hometown here in BC. They spent 3 weeks
  away from home and it was while they were evacuated that Michelle got
  the news that she is now ""active"" on the Transplant list.
  This means that BC Transplant is actively looking for a Donor Heart
  match for her and that they could get the call at anytime. Michelle will have to remain in Vancouver post-surgery in order to be
  monitored for symptoms of rejection and infection. She will not be
  able to be on her own in the weeks and months immediately following
  surgery and it is anticipated that she will have to remain in
  Vancouver for up to 12 months to participate in the rehabilitation process. I have always known Michelle to be kind and thoughtful and usually is
  happiest helping others or feeding people. She has a joyful and
  generous spirit and is beloved by many but especially friends and
  family. Will you help Michelle and Jamie and alleviate the pressure of
  this monumental journey they are about to go through? Even the
  smallest donation will help. Please donate today and help this very
  special person not have to worry and be focused on her recovery.",https://fundrazr.com/newheartformichelle

"13,380",Please Help Bob Continue Fighting Parkinson's!,U.S. Dollar,,of $50k goal,62,"Bob Sobo has been a servant of God and of people throughout his whole
  adult life.  He’s been an Associate Pastor, Senior Pastor and Shelter
  Manager for the San Fernando Valley Rescue Mission where he helped
  many homeless families get back on their feet.  Bob has also had a
  passion for music since boyhood, and he achieved professional status
  as a guitar player and songwriter. Bob has also been a devoted husband and father. He has dedicated his
  life to the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom; and yet that pursuit has
  never made him cold or impersonal.  Anyone who has heard Bob laugh
  knows this to be true!  His wry humor and rapier wit have the capacity
  to put any person at ease, as anyone who has spent time with him can
  attest to. Sadly, in December of 2006 when Bob was just 52, he was diagnosed
  with Parkinson’s Disease. Doctors believe that the onset was
  exacerbated by a head injury Bob incurred in a tragic traffic
  collision with a negligent driver in October of that year. This terrible accident occurred as he was heading to a musical gig. 
  Then, like now, he was accompanied by the incomparable Sandy Howell,
  who thankfully incurred only minor injuries.  As a result of that
  accident, the Parkinson’s which would most probably have laid dormant
  for the majority of Bob’s life, surfaced with a vengeance. This disease has exacted a terrible toll on Bob. The first thing that Parkinson’s took from Bob was his ability to
  make music with his guitar.   The loss of that light within the world
  has been immeasurable; anyone who has spent any time with Bob knows
  that a guitar in his hands is like a painter with fresh watercolors,
  staring at a beautiful vista… His ability to make that instrument sing
  shaped the majority of my childhood, and it was a shock to everyone
  around him when he couldn’t play anymore. But Bob persevered. The next thing that Parkinson’s took from Bob was his ability to
  drive and speak publicly. Everyone was taken by surprise at how Bob’s
  Parkinson’s advanced so quickly, and in such a degenerative manner. 
  Nonetheless, with the help of a few friends, family, and Ms. Sandy
  Howell, Bob was able to continue. Bob persevered. Despite all efforts to the contrary, things have gotten worse for
  Bob.  As a result, he now requires round-the-clock, live-in caregivers
  who assist him in all regular daily functions.  The financial
  assistance that is available to him through normal channels just is
  not at all sufficient to cover his medical and care costs.  He is
  desperate need of additional funding, and he has no means to procure
  it for himself.   He has had some additional help from a kind
  benefactor, but this major portion of his funding is going to come to
  an end, soon. So—the question becomes:  does anyone out there want to help out
  Bob?  He needs your help in order to persevere further.  He is working
  with therapists and doctors, and doing his best throughout all of
  these trials and tribulations.  Will you stand with him?  Can you? He doesn’t want to be in the position where he needs to ask for
  help.  Unfortunately, it’s gotten to the point of him actually needing
  to do so in order to survive.  I know it’s a lot to ask for in this
  day and age; we all have our issues and problems.  Trouble doesn’t
  discriminate, as I’m sure we all know. But Bob needs some help.  Please do what you can.  Let’s help Bob
  persevere further.   On his behalf, I thank each and every one of you
  for your time.  C’mon, let’s do this!",https://fundrazr.com/adLI0

"7,711",Road to Healing: Help Col with treatment and life!,U.S. Dollar,,of $42k goal,68,"A Message from Maria ... When I picture my friend Col, I envision light—a beautiful, warm,
  loving light. Her aura glows with this willingness to understand and empathize. That’s one of the reasons why this disease she has been battling is
  so difficult for me to come to grips with. It seems to be literally
  eating away at the insides of her physical body, and yet her mind and
  her spirit still keep glowing—still keep pushing on—despite the daily
  obstacles she faces. Col does not like to complain so she doesn't want us to list all of
  her symptoms, which are many. When you see her smiling and laughing
  with you, she's doing it amidst great pain and discomfort. Often it
  feels like she's dying. A number of her doctors don't take insurance and need to be paid out
  of pocket (just one office visit can cost $600!) and the treatment
  they prescribe is also not covered by insurance. She has been sick for
  numerous years so you can imagine the toll that that takes. Her illness is not something you'd know about unless you are close to
  her. But it's very serious and it severely impedes her quality of
  life. And her closest friends and family are very concerned— *We want her to be with us for years to come!* Please join me in doing what you can to help Col win this war within
  her body and pave her road to healing. A Message from Sue Elliott ... Have you ever met somebody — even online — and instantly loved that person? I’m not talking about lust. I’m not even talking about appreciation. What I mean is some sort of deep, soul-level recognition. A
  feeling like “home,” like “It’s so good to see you again after all
  these years! I do so adore you!” That’s how I felt about Col the first time I saw her photo and
  read a comment she had posted online in a business-oriented group
  years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten to know Col “better,” and I still have
  that same feeling. She’s like a cross between an angel, a friend and a sister! We have amazing conversations in which we both let go of all
  kinds of “stuff” that no longer serves us and we experience huge AHA moments! If you had asked me a year or so ago how I felt about Col, I
  would have told you that she’s a dear, dear friend, at the very least. And yet, as close as we had gotten on so many levels, I
  had NO idea that Col was often in severe physical pain. Not only does she not complain about pain, she’s so genuinely
  joyful and inspired and inspiring, it never dawned on me that she
  could be anything but energetic and “healthy.” Her very being exudes well-being! Col wrote a beautiful blog post that illustrates her approach to
  life and living, even in the midst of pain... even in the midst of
  illness. Please take a couple minutes to be inspired by the beauty of
  Col’s approach to — and dance with — life: Dancing in the Rain . Throughout the pain and the illness, Col has been giving to
  others in the most magnificent way. She created a FREE program called Magical Medical Mystery Tour , in which she
  interviewed amazing healers of all kinds. She created a forum in which
  these experts shared their wisdom freely with anyone who cared to
  participate. The gift of these interviews continues to unfold within
  me and, I’m sure, within all who were game for the adventure. So when Col told me that she now has one or two Western medical
  doctors for EACH of her organs! —and as much as she loves and
  appreciates them, Western medicine doesn’t seem to be working for her
  particular illness — I didn’t have to ask if she had tried natural and
  alternative healing modalities. I knew she had — with joy and
  enthusiasm and insight ... And yet, her body still has more to say — more insights to
  reveal — and it wants to reveal those insights and that wisdom through
  biological medicine. Col has received many “nudges” from the universe
  pointing her in that direction — and this is a woman who KNOWS how to
  listen to and dance with the universe. Like all great dances, it’s a two-way experience. There is
  giving and receiving. And there is constant expansion. One of the most obvious — and magnificent — benefits of this
  expansive dance with the universe and with pain and illness has been
  creativity. Everything that Col learns and experiences goes deep
  within her being and comes out as ART! Art with spirit. Art with soul. Art with purpose. And art that
  is infused with the energy of healing and a return to balance and wholeness! If you feel inspired, I encourage you to listen to your soul.
  Listen to your body. Listen to your inner response to Col’s artwork.
  And if something resonates deeply within you, please purchase it. Not only will you be bringing something beautiful and powerful
  into your own home or office, you will be helping to make Col’s dream
  come true, the universe-directed dream to receive biological treatment. I know I will be buying several pieces of Col’s work for myself
  and to give as gifts. And I know I will not be alone. Col is so loved
  by so many! Sue Elliott Founder/Editor-in-Chief of Law of Attraction Magazine www.LovingMyself.com ..................................................

      had a rough year in terms of work, medical procedures, lack of
      work and more procedures. Ethan finally went in and made
      it out of the heel cord surgery we've been anticipating for months. We found out that Ethan has an
      incredibly high arch and Dr. Dow said there is a chance that he
      will need more surgery. Right now, Ethan is not allowed
      to put any weight on his feet at all, meaning, I must stay home
      with him 24/7 in case of fire or emergency. I have to bathe him,
      help him use the restroom, dress him, feed him, and administer his
      medication, all while still attending online courses. I applied for SSI for Ethan
      over 3 months ago. I have received no response and cannot get
      through to the office. I have written to Senator Tim
      Scott, asking for any information that would point me in the right
      direction for any grants or funding that our particular situation
      could be eligible for. I have also written to the White House with
      the same questions. The only thing I have
      accomplished by reaching out to local, state and fed. gov. is that
      now my email is bombarded with stories of why ""this
      person"" is working for the people, etc... No one from the government (on
      any level) has even acknowledged our concerns, much less responded
      with any sort of advice on where to look. I am a single mom. My son has
      Aspergers. My son makes straight As. I currently have a 4.0 and I
      am actively taking college courses. Ethan's father has never paid
      child support and I cannot pursue him for financial assistance
      since he is not a US citizen. There must be something we are
      eligible for??!! One would think, right? Well, I have yet to find anything. I have always worked. I have
      always been Ethan's provider with the help from immediate family
      when really needed. Ethan does have Medicaid and we
      finally received food stamps. But what of rent? Utilities?
      Toiletries? School supplies? Anything that we cannot eat? It is not anyone's
      responsibility, and I absolutely hate that this is the place I
      have to turn AGAIN since I am not eligible for help since
      I am physically capable of working. Apparently, our situation falls
      in some grey area and no one can really give me an answer on how I
      can find help. If anyone knows of someone who
      can help us find these answers, Please let me know, as I am out of ideas. Once again, We thank you and
      love you so much for all of your continued support and, once more,
      I would never ask unless absolutely urgent and necessary. Thank you all... again. Please share, as the more who
      know, the better chance we can find some answers. Love, Steph and Ethan PS. Ethan is feeling much
      better and is taking this all so well, considering! He is an

    blindness, and a poor boy named Justin is one of them. Enchroma has
    created glasses which enhance colour vision so that individuals may
    see real, uncompromised colour for the first time! Like you and me, Justin wants the good things in life - health,
    love and freedom. But unlike you and me, there is something holding
    him back from his full potential - colour blindness. Justin is a healthy, competitive guy who loves to win. But due to
    extenuating circumstances, he takes the L a lot . At our
    volleyball season opener, he asked me at least five times,
    ""Which line is out?"" After about the third time, I began
    to shout, ""the green one!"" The issue was with the
    designers, who decided to paint lines on the gym floor overlapping
    in every direction, and with Justin, who could see nothing but
    differing shades of dull, similar-looking colours. Our team chose to
    blame the loss on the problem of Justin not being able to see the
    boundaries, definitely not because of his lack of skill. Justin also suffers in matters of love because of his difficulty
    with choosing a matching outfit, which may deter potential mates
    from approaching. The poor guy always needs help when shopping, and
    often asks the non-colour blind population for an opinion on his
    outfit before he goes out into public. Finally, Justin cannot reach the full potential of his freedom
    without possessing the ability to get around. Although driving does
    not always pose an issue, Justin sometimes has difficulty with
    traffic lights. He once said, ""All I know is that if the bottom
    circle is lit up, you stop. If it's the top circle, you go.""
    The real problem occurs when he visits a new place where they think
    it's a good idea to have horizontal traffic lights. As you can see, there are many obstacles for Justin to overcome,
    but it is my hope that Enchroma glasses will start him down the
    right track to achieving his goals! Please support Justin in his
    journey of becoming a man and help him see the real world for the
    first time! Anything helps, even a like or share! Below you will see some first time experiences with Enchroma:",https://fundrazr.com/b1IHv4

  expenses. We are asking you to help us raise funds for this school so
  that the children can obtain medical care at local clinics and
  hospitals. We continue to work with a local clinc and strengthen those
  ties. All funds go directly towards the cost of medical care. In 2016 fundraiser we raised $7,745.00, $1,235 more than the
  goal! The projected expenses for  medical care (including
  hospitalization, consults, labs, x-rays, scans, medicines,
  transportation, etc) for 2017 equates to $789.31 per month or $9471.73
  for the whole year. After we deducted the $1,235 ""excess"" we
  raised last year, the total goal for 2017 is $8,400. This puts us just past the financial goal. The reason for the increase in the budget this year is: The Quetzal has strengthened substantially compared to the
      USD, previously it was 7.75/1, now it is down to 7.3/1. Over the last year we have increased our numbers to 679

  hundreds of impoverished children obtain access to healthcare. We support children and their future. People (specifically children)
  are the best investment. In order to improve a population you need
  empowerment and independence. The proven form has been education.
  These children face countless socioeconomic and psychological
  barriers. A holistic approach is required to improve longterm
  outcomes. What these children face on a near daily basis makes all of
  our life obstacles seem pity. The staff and volunteers provide long

  for many years. They sometimes sell Scott's prints at the local movie theaters. Suzy has just been diagnosed
      with breast cancer. This is both emotionally devastating, and financially horrific. Scott
  and Suzy are already struggling to catch up from a period of financial
  hardship, and this is a mighty blow. What can you do? Spread the word . PLEASE tell others about this fundrazr effort. If even 20 people can

"4,680",Help Fund Nathan Zenarosa’s Jaw Surgery,Canadian Dollar,,of $5.1k goal,63,"I am hosting this fundraiser on behalf of my friend Ricard
    Zenarosa. This is his story: ""Nearly seventeen years ago, my son Nathan Zenarosa was
    born with a bilateral cleft lip and palate; and a hole in his heart. Thankfully when he was two years old the hole in his heart
    closed on its own, but the opening in his lip and palate prevented
    him from feeding/eating normally as he grew up. While we were still
    in the Philippines, he had to endure bullying and ridicule on a
    daily basis. He has had numerous operations to try to close the openings of
    his upper lip and palate, align his teeth so that they grow in the
    correct space and add bone grafts to the gaps in his gums. After all
    these surgeries, the opening in his palate continues to be an issue
    because it reopens as he grows older and bigger over the years. Nathan is scheduled for an operation on May 24 that will be a
    major step forward. It has the following procedures: Realignment of his upper jaw (maxillary) Realignment of his lower jaw (mandibular) Malar augmentation to offset realignment of the upper jaw Genioplasty to offset realignment of the lower jaw Closure of the opening of his palate The remarkable thing is that procedure 3 and 4 are considered
    cosmetic and are not covered under the Medical Services Plan (MSP),
    with an estimated cost of $7,000. While it is possible to not do
    these 2 steps, the idea that we would not do the best that we can
    for our son seems inconceivable. How could we subject him to this
    operation and then have the result compromised just because the
    expense is beyond our means? I am asking for your help in contributing to funding this
    portion of the upcoming operation and to spread the word about this
    campaign through your social network and contacts.  Any help would
    be greatly appreciated by Nathan and our whole family. Thanks you very much Richard Zenarosa"" Cleft lips and palates are the most common craniofacial
    malformations of newborns. It occurs when there is a failure of
    closure of the lips and bones of the palate. Serious feeding and
    airway problems occur and this leads to undernourishment and
    recurrent lung infections. Numerous surgical repair procedures are
    required to correct this problem.",https://fundrazr.com/81Evp8

"2,425",For the Love of Ben Durst,U.S. Dollar,,of $36.9k goal,30,"For those of you who do not know Ben Durst personally, I am sorry.
  For those of you that do know Ben, I am still sorry. But you know
  why..... (lol) Ben hit a cold reality when he was recently diagnosed with bladder
  cancer. It was a shock to say the least. He is too young and not ready
  to stop making people laugh. He wants to fight.  But he has a problem..... Ben is on Medicare. He does not have prescription drug coverage. The
  one medication he has to take at home to build his white blood cells
  after the chemo kills them off is $4,752 a prescription. He has 7
  refills. That's $33,264 for this prescription for his 4 cycles of
  chemo, and the month after. If he does not get this medication, the
  chemo will surely kill him. This medication will help him fight off
  infection since his white blood cells will no longer have those
  capabilities. There are organizations that will help, and he is in
  communication with them.  However, they are slow to reply and he needs
  to be sure he has financing. He was able to get the first prescription free. Ben has always had 2 goals in life... The first goal is to laugh and
  make others laugh. He went to the hospital telling people he was
  worried about a certain test because he didn't get to study for it. Of
  course, everyone laughed. He loves having parties and getting family
  together. He is always there for his Mom Evelyn, and his sister Lisa.
  He takes care of me, the house and my parents. Ben is a big guy with
  an even bigger heart. His other goal is to work. He is a truck driver and loves being on
  the road. He makes overnight deliveries while seeing the country. An
  active member Fraternal Organization of Eagles #3138 (Taylor, MI), he
  has often stopped in clubs around his delivery locations just to
  support the organization. All he wants to do now is get back to work
  and feel whole again. I am Suzette Pariseau and I have been Ben's better half for more
  than 6 years.  I am an ESL teacher and can take time off work to help
  him, but I do not get paid for the time I take off. Financially, I
  have to take care of our regular bills to keep us afloat.  Ben is also
  a proud man and would never ask for monetary help, so I am doing it
  for him. If you can donate and help him pay for his medications, it
  would be greatly appreciated.  Any amount would help. If you need any
  more information than what I have already posted, or would prefer to
  send a donation via snail-mail, please email me at parisuze@yahoo.com , or Cancer2017SUCKS@yahoo.com . Thank you for your generosity. Everyone loves a comedian. Please help keep Ben Durst laughing....",https://fundrazr.com/helpBenDurst
"438,642",British Gut,,,,,"This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The
      American Gut Project (AGP) to try to understand the bacterial
    diversity of the British Gut . *Notice: We are experiencing some delays with kit turnover, so
    please allow 2-3 weeks for your kit to arrive.* Many people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play
  an incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them,
  that they make up 90 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"". We
  evolved together with our microbiome over millions of years. Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe and, with your help,
  we will be able to discover more about the crucial relationship
  between our health and our microbiome, and on a personal level, you
  will be able to discover the bacterial profile of your own gut. With
  your help, we hope to be able to answer questions such as 'How much
  does our choice of lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and
  can we alter our microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has their
  own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out what
  constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of bacteria
  should try and be avoided. In order to do this ambitious and
  much-needed project, we urgently need a large scale collection of
  human samples. Over 7 thousand people have already signed up in
  America already- but we need many more from UK Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main 'microbial
  home', however, the study will also look at oral, skin and (for women)
  vaginal communities as these areas of the body have problems such as
  tooth decay, gum disease, acne and infertility and may be influenced
  by the microbiome. What does it entail? First you need to sign up (see Perks on the right) and select your
  level of contribution to the project. Within two weeks, you will
  receive a kit in the mail together with detailed instructions on how
  to proceed. Shipping within the UK first class should be around £2.90,
  but we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the
  proper postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is
  important since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely
  not produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
  sample to us, the samples will be processed and analysed by the Knight
  Lab at University of California, San Diego and you will be provided
  with a list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and the
  proportions in which they are found. We estimate that this will take
  around 3 months (but possibly longer) and once we provide you with
  your results, you will be able to see how your bacterial community
  compares to others in the study. From the diet and lifestyle
  information that you provide, we will also be able to show you how
  your results compare to other people who are within the same diet and
  lifestyle group as you (but having a very different result to them
  does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can just be that you have
  experienced slight lifestyle differences that mean that your bacterial
  profile is different). Please note that this is a scientific study, not a clinical or
      commercial project, and we will not be able to provide you with
      any clinical information related to your microbiome profile. How will my sample be used? The British Gut project, like the American model, gives participants
  the opportunity to compare their personal microbiome profiles to
  family members, and other people both in the UK and abroad. Our
  project is based on the principles of 'access to all'. The data
  collected from the sample you provide will be shared anonymously both
  with participants and scientists, allowing many different scientific
  hypotheses and questions to be answered using your valuable sample. We look forward to working together on this new and exciting project.
